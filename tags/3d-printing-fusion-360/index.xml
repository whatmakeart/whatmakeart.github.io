      <description>Transcript In this Autodesk Fusion 360 tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to make 3D printed 90-degree angle brackets. We&amp;rsquo;ll put a hole in this bracket so you can use it to attach to panels the sides of boxes shelves or anything else where you need 90-degree support, and you want it to be a custom size. We&amp;rsquo;ll also make this Fusion 360 model parametric. That way you can change the parameters and when that 90-degree angle bracket changes size based on the size of your 3D printing bed or the project that you&amp;rsquo;re working on.</description>

      <description>Transcript In this Autodesk Fusion 360 tutorial, Iâ€™m going to show you how to make a 3D printed bracket that you can use with laser cut projects. It will have slots in it that you can put panels and then either put bolts or screws to them so then you can make boxes or furniture or shelves that are connected in the corners in a way that may not be able to be done with laser cutting alone.</description>
