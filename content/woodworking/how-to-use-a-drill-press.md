1. **Choose the correct drill bit for the material you are drilling.** There are many different types of drill bits, each designed for a specific material. For example, you would use a different type of drill bit to drill wood than you would to drill metal.
2. **Set the speed of the drill press.** The speed of the drill press will depend on the material you are drilling and the size of the drill bit you are using. Consult a drill press speed chart to determine the correct speed.
3. **Secure the workpiece to the drill press table.** The workpiece is the material you are drilling. Use a clamp or vise to secure it to the drill press table so that it cannot move while you are drilling.
4. **Position the drill bit over the desired hole location.** Use the depth gauge to adjust the depth of the hole you want to drill.
5. **Turn on the drill press and slowly lower the drill bit into the workpiece.** Apply light pressure to the drill bit as you are lowering it.
6. **Once the hole has been drilled, release the pressure on the drill bit and allow it to return to its starting position.**
7. **Turn off the drill press.**

## Drill Press Safety

- Always wear safety glasses when using a drill press.
- Keep your hands away from the drill bit while it is rotating.
- Make sure the workpiece is securely clamped to the drill press table before you start drilling.
- Use a depth gauge to control the depth of the hole you are drilling.
- Do not force the drill bit. If the drill bit is binding, stop drilling and clear the obstruction.

## Drill Press Tips:

- If you are drilling a deep hole, withdraw the drill bit periodically to clear the chips.
- Use a lubricant on the drill bit to reduce friction and heat.
- If you are drilling a hole in metal, use a cutting fluid to cool the drill bit and prevent it from overheating.
