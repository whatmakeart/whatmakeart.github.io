## Evaporative Finishes

All finishes have an evaporative process but some finishes only use evaporation of solvents to cure without any further chemical reaction

- Shelac - solvent usually alcohol
- Laquer - solvent usually laquer thinner don't crosslink and cure/dry by evaporation alone have spaghetti like strands that pile on top of each other not water or vapor proof
- Crosslinking or Polemerizing Finishes These finishes have solids floating in solvent / thinner that form chemical bonds as the solvent evaporates.

The key difference from Evaporative Finishes is that if solvent is reapplied it does not break the chemical bonds of the solids
