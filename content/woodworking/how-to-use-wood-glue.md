# How to Use Wood Glue

This tutorial will show you how to use wood glue to join pieces of wood together that are stronger than the original pieces. It is important to know the structure of wood and wood grain, meaning that wood grain runs in a parallel direction and is similar to a pack of spaghetti.

It is best to use a clamping force to smash two pieces of wood together. So the long strains of the grain interlock and the glue fills in the gaps. This high pressure is required to have a strong wood glue joint.
