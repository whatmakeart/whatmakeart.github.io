Sewing is the process to mechanically attach pieces of fabric together with a needle and thread.

## Sewing Quick Start

To get started sewing you only need a few basic supplies.

### Minimum Hand Sewing Supplies

- [Hand Needles](hand-needles.md)
- [Thread](thread.md)
- [Fabric](fabric.md)
- Scissors

Beyond the bare minimum it is a good idea to begin collect [basic sewing tools](basic-sewing-tools.md).

## Hand Sewing vs Machine Sewing

[Hand sewing](hand-sewing.md) has existed for thousands of years and can be done anywhere and doesn't need electricity. Some sewing stitches and tailoring techniques can only be done by hand such as a decorative hand stitched buttonhole. The stitches made by hand are different than those made by a machine. Hand sewing is an important skill to know but or anyone pursuing sewing for more than the occasional emergency garment repair, a sewing machine is an essential tool.

Early sewing machines also did not need electricity but instead used the caloric burn of the operator through a foot pedal to move the needle and make stitches. A machine stitch will generally be more consistent, faster, and stronger than a hand stitch. Whenever possible a machine should be used to sew materials together so time is not wasted with less effective hand stitching. Just about every kind of stitch can be made by various sewing machines.

### Domestic vs Industrial Machines

Domestic sewing machines or consumer sewing machines are cheap and versatile. Most can sew a multitude of stitch types but because they are not single purpose built they tend to do each task worse than a dedicated machine. For example, a multi-purpose domestic machine may have an edge stitch function to try to capture fraying fabric edges, but it would be no match for even a domestic serger.

All domestics sewing machines can sew in a straight line, but they will be limited in the thickness of fabric that they can sew through, and the number of layers of even thin fabric that they can simultaneously sew through as well as the maximum thread weight that can be used. Generally, if one is careful, they can work around these issues. But eventually the strength and specific built purpose of industrial machines is essential to make sewn objects.
