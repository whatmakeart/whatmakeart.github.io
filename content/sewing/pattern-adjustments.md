### Adjusting Buttondown Shirt for a Full Belly

- unbutton shirt so side seam does not pull
- Check if side seam is in correct place and confirm back of shirt is correct size.
- Measure space on center front of abdomen and divide by 2 for the amount ot add to one side of the pattern.
- Measure and mark where the the greatest circumference of the abdomen is and mark on pattern
- draw line from lower part of arm hole to this abdomen mark
- Then draw straight down.
- Cut the line and pivot from the arm hold until the spacing is added.
- Cut straight to the center placket from the abdomen mark.
- move this pice down to match the bottom seam
- Fill in the gaps with paper
- This method keeps the side seam the same and does not require sleeve adjustments since the armhole length stays the same.
