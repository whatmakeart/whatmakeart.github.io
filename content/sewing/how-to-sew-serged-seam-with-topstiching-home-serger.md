## How to Sew a Serged Seam with Top Stitching on Home Machine Transcript

</summary>

In this sewing tutorial I'm going to show you how to serge and then top stitch. Notice that this is already stitched together this is common with woven fabrics and when you want more strength in your serged seam. Now i'm going to trim off the seam allowances with the serger and this will also encapsulate the raw edges of the fabric. I'll sew straight along at my desired width for the finish.

Once again when using a serger, make sure you pull the chain far out and cut enough of the chain to stay on the fabric and some by the serger. Now when we unfold this notice that we have the original stitching just like a plain seam but now we have the serger finishing off the edges. Then we can go back to the regular sewing machine and we're going to stitch this down this is a great finish for out-seams on slacks or jeans.

You can go ahead and top stitch right along and it will make this seam a little stronger and it'll also keep everything in place. Stitch a bit, then back stitch, then go straight down. It's important that you go straight along the edge that way the stitching looks straight and is not wonky and wobbly. Back stitch then lift your needle and trim any excess threads. Now you have a nice stylish seam that is encapsulated on the inside with the overlocking serger and then you can go ahead and press it down on the ironing board. It's mostly pressed down now but just adding a little press to it will keep everything in place. Now you know how to sew a serged seam with top stitching. Happy sewing!
