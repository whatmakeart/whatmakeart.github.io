1. How can I use thicker thread in the machine?

You need to use a larger needle. We have larger needles and the cabinet. A size 16 or 18 will work. You also need to adjust the bobbin case tension. When adjusting the bobbin case tension the little turn of the screw goes a long way. Maybe eighth to a quarter turn.

2. How to accurately sew curves?

Focus on the tangent point of the curve as it goes by the needle. It is a mistake to look at the fabric as it approaches the presser foot. Look at the fabric as it is tangent to the needle since that is where the curve is.

3. What do thread size numbers mean?
