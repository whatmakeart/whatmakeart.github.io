# How to Adjust Sewing Machine Tension

This tutorial will show you how to diagnose sewing machine thread tension issues and fix the tension so you have smooth and even stitches.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial you should be familiar with:

- [How to Thread an Juki DDL 870 Industrial Sewing Machine](../tutorials/how-to-thread-an-juki-ddl-870-industrial-sewing-machine.md) and / or [How-to-Thread-a-Home-Sewing-Machine](../tutorials/how-to-thread-a-home-sewing-machine.md)
- [How to Wind a Bobbin](../tutorials/how-to-wind-a-bobbin.md)

## Instructions

The first step is to determine if the upper thread tension or the bobbin thread tension is the problem. Generally you set the bobbin tension once after you selected your thread and only change it if you change the thickness of your thread. Then you adjust the upper thread tension with the knob, usually on the front of the sewing machine.
