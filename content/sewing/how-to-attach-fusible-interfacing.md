Fusible interfacing attaches to fabric with glue and stiffens the fabric and makes it stronger. IT is often used in garment facings, around pockets and button holes, and other locations where more dimension is desired.

Fusible interfacing has glue on one side that is activated with the heat of a clothing iron. Usually the glue side has a bumpy texture. Fusible interfacing comes in different weights depending on how how much stiffness or reinforcement is desired.

Make sure to press the iron down and keep it still until the interfacing is fully fused. Then lift the iron up vertically rather than dragging it. If the iron is dragged it can create ripples or stretching of the fabric.
