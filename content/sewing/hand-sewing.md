### Types of Hand Stitches

- **Blind Stitch** - nearly invisible on one side of the fabric
- **Blanket Stitch** - binds the threads on the edge of woven fabrics to prevent unraveling - See: [How to Sew a Blanket Stitch](how-to-sew-a-blanket-stitch.md)
- **Overcast or Whipstich** - wraps around the edges of fabric and can prevent fraying, can also join pieces of fabric together such as a hem - See: [How to Sew an Overcast Stitch](how-to-sew-an-overcast-stitch.md)
- **Buttonhole Stitch** - similar to the blanket stitch but ties a knot with each stitch to make the stitching more durable to the wear and tear of button insertion
- **Backstich** - basic hand stitch that is similar to the running stitch except that after coming back through the fabric, the sewer goes back to the location of the previous stitch and pushes the need through the fabric at the same location, doubling up the stitch - See: [How to Sew a Backstich](how-to-sew-a-backstich.md)
- **Basting Stitch** - temporary stitch used to hold pieces of fabric together during the construction process or to quickly mock up a form to check size and fit - See: [How to Sew a Basting Stitch](how-to-sew-a-basting-stitch.md)
- **Running Stitch** - basic hand stitch that goes into the fabric, travels a bit, and then back through the fabric in the opposite way. Multiple stitches can be made at once - See: [How to Sew a Running Stitch](how-to-sew-a-running-stitch.md)
