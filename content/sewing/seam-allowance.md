A seam allowance is extra fabric that extends past where the seam will be stitched. Patterns and projects have different seam allowances depending on the purpose and technique used. Commercial patterns often have 1/2" or less seam allowance while home sewing patterns can have 5/8" or more seam allowance to allow for more alterations of fit during the [sewing](./sewing.md) process.
