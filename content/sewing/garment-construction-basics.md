[Sewing](sewing.md) a garment is a great way to learn pattern making and many useful fabric fabrication techniques. Generally, the pieces are cut in specific shapes that after sewn together will create a three-dimensional form. Often these forms are to fit around the shape of the human body or a piece of architecture.
