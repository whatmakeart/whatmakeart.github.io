## How to Export SketchUp Models for Rendering

In this tutorial, I will show you how to export your SketchUp models for rendering in other applications. You can export your SketchUp models to [Blender](../blender/blender.md), a free and open source 3D modeling program, and to Maya, a professional 3D animation software.

To export your SketchUp model, follow these steps:

1. Save your model and clean it up as much as possible.
2. Go to Window > Model Info and click Purge Unused.
3. Go to File > Export 3D Model.
4. Select the file format you want to export to.
5. In the Options dialog box, uncheck the "Triangulate faces" option and check the "Preserve component hierarchies" option if you want to keep the instances.
6. Click OK and export your model.

Here are some tips for exporting your SketchUp models for rendering:

- Use a high-quality mesh. The better the quality of your mesh, the better your rendered model will look.
- Use smooth shading. Smooth shading will give your model a more realistic appearance.
- Use textures. Textures can add a lot of realism to your rendered models.
