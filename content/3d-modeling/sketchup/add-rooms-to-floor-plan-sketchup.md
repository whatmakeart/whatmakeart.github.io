## How to Add Additional Rooms to Your Floor Plan in SketchUp

In this video, I will show you how to add additional rooms to your floor plan in [SketchUp](sketchup.md). I will demonstrate two different methods, and I will also provide tips on how to avoid creating extra faces and geometry.

### Method 1: Using the Rectangle Tool

1. Open SketchUp and create a new file.
2. Click on the Rectangle Tool (R).
3. Draw a rectangle that is the size of the room you want to add.
4. Press the Offset Command (F) and enter the thickness of your walls.
5. Click on the Pull Tool (P) and pull the walls up.
6. Add doors and windows as desired.

### Method 2: Using the Tape Measure Tool

1. Open SketchUp and create a new file.
2. Click on the Tape Measure Tool (T).
3. Measure the width and length of the room you want to add.
4. Draw a line that is the same width and length as the room.
5. Press the Push/Pull Tool (P) and pull the line up.
6. Add doors and windows as desired.

## Tips for Avoiding Extra Faces and Geometry

- When you are creating walls, make sure that they are all connected. This will help to prevent extra faces from being created.
- When you are adding doors and windows, make sure that they are flush with the walls. This will help to prevent extra geometry from being created.
- Use the Eraser Tool (E) to clean up any extra faces or geometry that you create.
