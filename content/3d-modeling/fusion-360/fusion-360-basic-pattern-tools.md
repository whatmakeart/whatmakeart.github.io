## Examples of Patterns in the Environment

**Examples of Rectangular Patterns:** The windows in a building, legs of a table or chair, drawers in a cabinet, buttons on a game controller, wheels on a car, pixels on a computer monitor, and the aisles in a retail store are all layed out in neat rectangular rectangular patterns.

Where else do you see rectangular patterns?

**Examples of Circular Patterns:** The blades on a drone, cutouts on a custom car rim, bars on a merry-go-round, ridges on a cut drinking glass, grid fins on a rocket, nubs on the grip handle of a mountain bike, and are examples of circular patterns.

**Examples of Patterns Along a Path:** The lamp posts along a winding parkway, LEDs in a fancy car headlight, cut outs in an organic chair, and ridges along the grip of a cordless drill are examples of patterns along a path.
