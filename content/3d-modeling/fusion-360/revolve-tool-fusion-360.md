## How to Use the Revolve Tool in Fusion 360

In this Autodesk [Fusion 360](fusion-360.md) tutorial, I will quickly show you how to use the revolve tool. The revolve tool is a powerful feature that allows you to create complex forms from simple sketches.

To use the revolve tool, first create a sketch. You can draw any shape you want, but the sketch must be closed. Once you have created your sketch, select the revolve tool from the toolbar.

The revolve tool will ask you to select a profile and an axis. The profile is the shape that you want to revolve around the axis. The axis can be any line or edge in your sketch.

Once you have selected the profile and the axis, click OK. Fusion 360 will create a new body that is revolved around the axis.

You can change the direction of the revolve by clicking the Direction button. You can also change the number of degrees that the revolve goes around by clicking the Degrees button.

The revolve tool is a powerful feature that can be used to create a variety of shapes. With a little practice, you will be able to create complex forms quickly and easily.

### Here are some additional tips for using the revolve tool:

- You can use the revolve tool to create symmetrical shapes. To do this, create a sketch that is symmetrical about a line or edge. Then, select the line or edge as the axis for the revolve.
- You can use the revolve tool to create tapered shapes. To do this, create a sketch that has a taper. Then, select the taper as the axis for the revolve.
- You can use the revolve tool to create compound shapes. To do this, create multiple sketches and then revolve each sketch separately.

I hope this tutorial has helped you learn how to use the revolve tool in Fusion 360. Please let me know if you have any questions.
