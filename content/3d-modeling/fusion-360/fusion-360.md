Fusion 360 is a [parametric modeling](../parametric-modeling.md) program combined with CAM output for [CNC milling](../../digital-fabrication/cnc/cnc-basics.md), [laser cutting](../../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting/laser-cutting.md), and [3D printing](../../digital-fabrication/3d-printing/3d-printing.md) that simplifies going from digital ideas inside the computer to physical output.

## Autodesk Fusion QuickStart Orientation & Setup

- Install Fusion <!-- TODO Fusion 360 Install Video -->
- [Education License](autodesk-education-licence-fusion.md)
- [User Interface Fusion](user-interface-fusion-360.md)
- [Fusion Fundamentals (Start Here)](fusion-fundamentals.md)
- Navigation Basics: Orbit, Pan, Zoom, ViewCube, Essential Shortcuts
- [Fusion 360 FAQ](fusion-360-faq.md)
- [Fusion 360 Rule #1](rule-number-one-fusion-360.md)

The basic Fusion workflow follows the pattern of making a 2D sketch and then extruding 3D features from the profiles of the sketch. To edit a form in Fusion it is best to edit the original sketch if possible.

### Fusion 360 Sculpting

In addition to traditional parametric CAD modeling tools, Fusion 360 also has a sculpting workspace that uses [t-splines to make organic forms](organic-forms-with-t-splines-fusion-360.md).

### Fusion 360 Rendering

Fusion 360 has a robust local and cloud rendering engine with built in materials. Some materials are fully 3D mapped and seamlessly cover complex shapes and forms. Get started with [basic rendering in Fusion 360](basic-rendering-fusion-360.md)

## Parametric Modeling

Parametric modeling allows the use of variables or parameters to stand in for hard coded dimensions in the 3D model. Instead of defining a dimension "height" as 50mm one could define "height" as "width x 2" where width = 25mm.

### Parametric Formulas for Fusion 360

#### Geodesic Formula for Fusion 360

golden_ratio = (1+sqrt(5))/2 length = width * golden_ratio width = sqrt(4*sphere_radius^2/(1+golden_ratio^2))
