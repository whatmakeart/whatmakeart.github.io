## Examples of Patterns in the Environment

### Examples of Rectangular Patterns

A rectangular pattern can have 1, 2, or 3 directional axis to form a grid to arrange the pattern. The windows in a building, legs of a table or chair, drawers in a cabinet, buttons on a game controller, wheels on a car, pixels on a computer monitor, and the aisles in a retail store are all laid out in neat rectangular rectangular patterns.

Where else do you see rectangular patterns?

### Examples of Circular Patterns

A circular pattern follows the contour of a circle. It may or may not go all the way around the circumference of the circle. The blades on a drone, cutouts on a custom car rim, bars on a merry-go-round, ridges on a cut drinking glass, grid fins on a rocket, nubs on the grip handle of a mountain bike, and are examples of circular patterns.

### Examples of Patterns Along a Path

The lamp posts along a winding parkway, LEDs in a fancy car headlight, cut outs in an organic chair, and ridges along the grip of a cordless drill are examples of patterns along a path.

## Pattern Tools in Autodesk Fusion

[Fusion 360](fusion-360.md) allows you to create patterns of objects or features. This is a powerful way to make complex additions to a model in a quick and editable way. You can create a rectangular pattern, a circular pattern, or a pattern on a path.

Examine everyday objects around you and look for different types of patterns.

- **Rectangular Pattern** - Lays out objects or features along a rectangular pattern from a central origin. [Rectangular Pattern Video Demo](https://youtu.be/Y0nYNZvL0EA)
- **Circular Pattern** - Lays out objects or features along a circular pattern from a central origin. <!-- TODO Circular pattern video Fusion -->
- **Pattern Along a Path** - Lays out objects or features along a custom linear path that can be organic, geometric, or a combination. [Video demonstration of pattern along a path.](https://youtu.be/9xit7JRPQ0A)

### Pattern Best Practices in Fusion

In Fusion it is better to make patterns in the 3D workspace rather than in 2D sketches. This is also true for[mirroring objects ](how-to-mirror-a-body-fusion-360.md) in Fusion. Avoiding 2D sketch patterns increases efficiency, improves performance, and allows more flexibility for design iteration. The recommended workflow is to create a solid, or extrude, or design feature and [//]: # (TODO: This is also a highly portable comment method.) <!-- TODO 3D Patterns vs 2D Sketch Patterns video Fusion>
