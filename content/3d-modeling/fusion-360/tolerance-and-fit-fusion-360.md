## How to Add Tolerance to Models for CNC Machining in Autodesk Fusion 360

In this Autodesk Fusion 360 tutorial, I will show you how to add tolerance to models for CNC Machining. This is important because it allows you to ensure that your parts fit together properly, even if there is some misalignment or measurement error.

### Step 1: Add Tolerance to the Model

There are two ways to add tolerance to a model in Autodesk Fusion 360:

#### In the Model

You can add tolerance to the model by editing the dimensions of the model. To do this, select the dimension you want to change and type in the new value. For example, if you want to add a 0.1mm tolerance to the width of a part, you would type in "width + 0.1mm".

#### In the Manufacturer Workspace

You can also add tolerance to a model in the Manufacturer Workspace. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Design > Manufacture menu.
2. Click on the Setup tab.
3. Click on the Create Manufacturing Model button.
4. In the Manufacturing Model dialog box, select the model you want to add tolerance to and click on the OK button.
5. In the Manufacturing Model workspace, right-click on the model and select Edit Manufacturing Model.
6. In the Edit Manufacturing Model dialog box, select the dimensions you want to change and type in the new values.
7. Click on the OK button.

### Step 2: Create a CNC Tool Path

Once you have added tolerance to your model, you can create a CNC tool path. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Design > Manufacture menu.
2. Click on the CAM tab.
3. Click on the Create Tool Path button.
4. In the Create Tool Path dialog box, select the type of tool path you want to create and click on the OK button.
5. In the Tool Path Editor, select the model you want to create the tool path for and click on the OK button.
6. In the Tool Path Editor, configure the tool path settings and click on the OK button.
7. The CNC tool path will be created.

### Step 3: Cut the Model

Once you have created a CNC tool path, you can cut the model. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Design > Manufacture menu.
2. Click on the CAM tab.
3. Click on the Cut button.
4. In the Cut dialog box, select the CNC tool path you want to use and click on the OK button.
5. The model will be cut.

I hope this tutorial has helped you to learn how to add tolerance to models for CNC Machining in Autodesk Fusion 360.
