## Sketching

- Always make something in the sketch that is on the origin or referenced to the origin
- If you create a centerline and then dimension from the center line you can input ⌀ diameter dimensions instead or radius dimensions or ⌀ diameter / 2. This can be helpful with sketches that are intended to be revolved. The centerline must be selected before the sketch line.
