## Sketching

Always make something in the sketch that is on the origin or referenced to the origin
If you create a centerline and then dimension from the center line you can input ⌀ diameter dimensions instead or radius dimensions or ⌀ diameter / 2. This can be helpful with sketches that are intended to be revolved. The centerline must be selected before the sketch line.

Digital Caliper Trick

- Measure center to center of threaded holes - First measure diameter of one of the fasteners. then zero the calipers. Then put both fasteners solidly in the threaded holes. measure the outside distance of the fasteners. Since the calipers were zeroed with one fastener diameter, then it is automatically subtracted out and you get an accurate center to center distance.
