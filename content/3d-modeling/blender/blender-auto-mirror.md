## How to Quickly Mirror Objects in Blender with Auto Mirror

In this [Blender](./blender.md) tutorial, I'll show you how to quickly mirror objects using the Auto Mirror add-on. This is a great way to speed up your modeling workflow and get into creating interesting forms without having to spend a lot of time on the tedious mirroring process.

## Here's how to use Auto Mirror:

1. Enable the Auto Mirror add-on in Blender's Preferences.
2. In Object Mode, select the object you want to mirror.
3. In the Sidebar, click on the Edit tab and then the Auto Mirror button.
4. Auto Mirror will slice the object in half and add a Mirror modifier.
5. You can now continue to work with the object as usual.

## Here are some tips for using Auto Mirror:

- You can choose the axis along which you want to mirror the object.
- You can also choose to delete the mirrored half of the object or keep it.
- Auto Mirror can be used on any object, including meshes, curves, and surfaces.
