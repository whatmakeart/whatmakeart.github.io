[Blender](https://www.blender.org) is a free, open source 3D modeling and digital content creation software package that "supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline â€” modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation" [^1] Since Blender is free, it can be used to make commercial content, unlike much of the software that you use as a student. Most software companies provide generous educational access to their software to students but this access stops after graduation. By learning multiple 3D modeling programs, you gain a better understanding of the concepts and have better versatility outside of school. Using Blender, allows you to create and sell your content from day one. This does not make it the best or better, but it is a good reason to know how to use it. Blender is a [3D Modeling](../3d-modeling.md) program that can also make [animations](../../video/animation.md).
