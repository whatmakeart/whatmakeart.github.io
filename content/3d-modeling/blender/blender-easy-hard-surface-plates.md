## How to Make Steel Plates and Hard Surface Models in Blender

In this [Blender](./blender.md)tutorial, I will show you how to quickly change planes into steel plates or panels or any kind of hard surface geometry very quickly using a few modifiers.

There are two different ways to do this. One will use a stacked sub-division modifier and the other will use a stacked bevel and sub-division modifier. Each has their advantages and disadvantages.

### Stacked Sub-division Modifier

The stacked sub-division modifier is very easy to use. Simply add a sub-division modifier to your plane and then increase the number of subdivisions until you get the desired level of detail.

The advantage of this method is that it is very quick and easy. The disadvantage is that it can add a lot of geometry to your model, which can slow down your computer and make it harder to work with.

### Stacked Bevel and Sub-division Modifier

The stacked bevel and sub-division modifier is a bit more complex to use, but it can give you more control over the final look of your model.

To use this method, first add a bevel modifier to your plane. Then, set the bevel limit method to "None" and the shape to 1. Finally, add a sub-division modifier and adjust the number of subdivisions until you get the desired level of detail.

The advantage of this method is that it gives you more control over the final look of your model and it doesn't add as much geometry to your model as the stacked sub-division modifier. The disadvantage is that it is a bit more complex to use.

## Which Method Should You Use?

The best method for you will depend on your specific needs. If you need a quick and easy way to make steel plates or panels, then the stacked sub-division modifier is a good option. If you need more control over the final look of your model and you don't mind spending a bit more time, then the stacked bevel and sub-division modifier is a better option.

### Here are the steps on how to make steel plates and hard surface models in Blender using the stacked bevel and sub-division modifier:

1. Create a plane.
2. Add a bevel modifier to the plane.
3. Set the bevel limit method to "None" and the shape to 1.
4. Add a sub-division modifier to the plane.
5. Adjust the number of subdivisions until you get the desired level of detail.
6. Extrude the edges of the plane to create the desired shape.
7. Add any other details you want to the model.
8. Save your model.

#### Here are some tips for making steel plates and hard surface models in Blender:

- Use the bevel modifier to control the thickness and sharpness of the edges of your model.
- Use the sub-division modifier to add detail to your model.
- Extrude the edges of your model to create the desired shape.
- Add any other details you want to the model.
- Save your model.

I hope this tutorial helps you make steel plates and hard surface models in Blender.
