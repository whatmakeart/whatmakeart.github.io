BlenderKit is a fantastic resource for users of [Blender](blender.md), an open-source [3D modeling program](../3d-modeling-software.md). It offers a vast library of assets that can significantly enhance your 3D modeling projects. Many of these assets are royalty-free, and there’s even a paid plan that grants access to a broader range of items. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to install BlenderKit with Blender 4.2:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [blenderkit.com](https://www.blenderkit.com).
2. Click on the “Download BlenderKit” button. This will download a ZIP file containing everything needed for installation.
3. Check your downloads to make sure the BlenderKit file remains in ZIP format. Some browsers might automatically extract ZIP files, resulting in a folder instead of a ZIP file.
4. If you find a folder instead of a ZIP file, compress the folder back into a ZIP file. This is essential because Blender requires the ZIP format for addon installation.
5. Open Blender on your computer.
6. Click on `Edit` in the top menu bar, then select `Preferences` from the dropdown menu. This opens the Preferences window.
7. In the Preferences window, select the `Add-ons` tab on the left-hand side.
8. Click on the downward carrot (a small dropdown arrow) at the top, and choose the option to `Install from Disk`.
9. Navigate to the location where you saved the BlenderKit ZIP file, select it, and click `Install from Disk`.
10. Once installed, you will see an option for the BlenderKit Online Asset Library. Ensure that this checkbox is ticked to activate the add-on.

Blender Kit is an amazing resource for Blender, a 3D modeling program that is open source. Blender Kit has many, many assets that you can use in your 3D modeling projects. Many times royalty free. There's even a paid plan that gives you access to more assets. But how do we install BlenderKit to be able to use it with blender, especially, how do we install BlenderKit with Blender 4.2?

The first thing to do is to go to blenderkit.com, then click Download BlenderKit. This will download a zip file that has everything that you need to know. It's important to note that earlier versions of BlenderKit did not work with 4.2, so go ahead and download the most recent version. Once you have the BlenderKit zip file in your downloads, you're ready to open up Blender and install.

Make sure that it's still a zip file. Sometimes you may have your browser set that it automatically extract zip files. If that's the case and you have a folder here, you need to recompress it as a zip file. Otherwise you can't install BlenderKit with Blender.

Once you have Blender open, go to Edit Preferences. We can go to add ons. Notice that after Blender version four, the add ons section is very much cleaned up. There's a new way to get extensions and add ons directly from the Blender website. If we click this little down carrot at the top, we can install from disk if I click this item. Then navigate to where you have BlenderKit zip file, select it, then select install from disk. Once this happens, you'll notice you have the BlenderKit online Asset library installed in Blender 4.2.

Now I can search for all types of things such as a hammer. And then we can see all the different hammers. Some of these have padlocks because they're only available with the paid subscription, but you can see a preview to see if you want to purchase a subscription to get that asset. Over here in the filters of BlenderKit, we can go ahead and select free first. And this will filter out the free hammers. And then if I see a hammer that I like, for example this one and I select it, it will come into my Blender scene.

This cube is in the way. So I move it away and then I'll zoom in and I can see this hammer right here that I can rotate and move any way I want. I can close the preview of BlenderKit, look at Material Preview here. And then we can see how the textures are imported automatically from BlenderKit. So hopefully this helps you install BlenderKit with Blender 4.2 from a zip file and install it as a local disk add on. Happy 3D modeling!
