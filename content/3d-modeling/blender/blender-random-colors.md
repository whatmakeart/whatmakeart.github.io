## How to Color Many Objects with a Single Material in Blender

In this [Blender](./blender.md) tutorial, I will show you how to color many objects with a single material in Blender. This is a great way to save time and effort when you need to create a scene with a lot of objects.

To do this, we will use the following steps:

1. Create a new material and add a color ramp node.
2. Connect the color ramp node to the base color of the material.
3. Set the random factor of the color ramp node to a value between 0 and 1.
4. Apply the material to the objects you want to color.

That's it! You can now have many objects with different colors using a single material.

Here are some additional tips:

- You can use the color ramp node to create a variety of different color schemes.
- You can also use the random factor to create a more random distribution of colors.
- You can use this technique to color any type of object in Blender.

I hope this tutorial was helpful!
