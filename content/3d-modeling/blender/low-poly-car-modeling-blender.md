## How to Model a Low Poly Car in Blender

In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to model a low poly car using the cube or box modeling method. This is a great way to learn the basics of 3D modeling and it's also a lot of fun!

## What you will need:

- Blender
- A basic understanding of how to use Blender

## Steps:

1. Start by creating a new cube in Blender.
2. Add a mirror modifier to the cube. This will allow you to model half of the car and the other half will be automatically mirrored.
3. Add some edge loops to the cube to give it more shape.
4. Use the inset tool to create the wheel wells.
5. Scale down the wheel wells and move them into position.
6. Add some more edge loops to the car to give it more detail.
7. Use the extrude tool to create the headlights, taillights, and bumpers.
8. Add some materials to the car to make it look more realistic.
9. Export the car to a format that you can use in your game engine or 3D printer.

## Here are some tips for modeling a low poly car:

- Use as few polygons as possible to keep the model simple.
- Use edge loops to add detail without adding too many polygons.
- Use the inset tool to create smooth curves.
- Use the extrude tool to add features like headlights and taillights.
- Add materials to make the car look more realistic.

**I hope this tutorial has helped you learn how to model a low poly car in Blender.**
