## How to Texture Paint a Complex 3D Object in Blender

In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to texture paint a complex 3D object. Texture painting is a powerful tool that can be used to add realistic textures to objects.

We will start by creating a simple texture for a cube. We will then UV unwrap the cube so that we can paint on it. Finally, we will add a roughness map and a metallic map to the cube.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to texture paint complex 3D objects in Blender.

## What You Will Learn

- How to create a texture for a cube
- How to UV unwrap an object
- How to add a roughness map to an object
- How to add a metallic map to an object
