## Process

1. Import the floor plan image into [Blender](blender.md).
2. Rotate the image so that it is as horizontal as possible.
3. Decide which dimension of the floor plan you want to use to scale the image.
4. Create a cube in Blender and set its dimensions to the same as the dimension you chose in step 3.
5. Move the cube into the same position as the floor plan image.
6. Set the pivot point of the floor plan image to the 3D cursor.
7. Scale the floor plan image to the same size as the cube.
8. Check the accuracy of the scaled floor plan image by comparing it to other dimensions on the floor plan.

Here are the floor plan scale steps in more detail:

1. Import the floor plan image into Blender.

   - Press `Shift`+`A` and select `Image` > `Image Reference`.
   - Browse to the floor plan image and click `Open`.

2. Rotate the image so that it is as horizontal as possible.

   - Press `Alt`+`R` to rotate the image.
   - Use the mouse to rotate the image until it is as horizontal as possible.

3. Decide which dimension of the floor plan you want to use to scale the image.

   - Look at the floor plan and find a dimension that is easy to measure.
   - This could be the length of a wall, the width of a room, or the overall size of the floor plan.
   - Choose the longest length possible

4. Create a cube in Blender and set its dimensions to the same as the dimension you chose in step 3.

   - Press `Shift`+`A` and select `Mesh` > `Cube`.
   - In the `Properties` panel, set the `X` dimension of the cube to the same value as the dimension you chose in step 3.

5. Move the cube into the same position as the floor plan image.

   - Click on the cube to select it.
   - Press `G` and drag the cube into the same position as the floor plan image.

6. Set the pivot point of the floor plan image to the 3D cursor.

   - In the `Properties` panel, click on the `Pivot Point` button.
   - Select `3D Cursor` from the list of options.

7. Scale the floor plan image to the same size as the reference cube.

   - Press `S` to scale the floor plan image.

8. Check the accuracy of the scaled floor plan image by comparing it to other dimensions on the floor plan.
   - Look at the floor plan and find other dimensions that you can measure.
   - Compare the scaled floor plan image to the other dimensions and make sure that they are the same.
