## How to Use Rigid Body Physics in Blender

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use rigid body physics in Blender. You will learn how to create active and passive rigid bodies, how to change the properties of rigid bodies, and how to animate rigid bodies.

### What You Will Need

- Blender
- A computer with a good graphics card

## Instructions

1. Create a new scene in Blender.
2. Add a cube to the scene by pressing `Shift`+`A` and selecting "Cube" from the menu.
3. Select the cube and go to the Physics tab in the properties window.
4. Click on the "Rigid Body" checkbox.
5. Press play to see the cube fall under the influence of gravity.
6. Add a plane to the scene by pressing `Shift`+`A` and selecting "Plane" from the menu.
7. Select the plane and go to the Physics tab in the properties window.
8. Click on the "Rigid Body" checkbox and set the type to "Passive".
9. Press play to see the cube fall onto the plane.
10. Change the properties of the rigid bodies to see how it affects the simulation. For example, you can change the mass, friction, and bounciness of the objects.
11. Animate the rigid bodies by moving them around in the scene.

### Tips

- You can use the "Rigid Body Tools" addon to create and edit rigid bodies more easily.
- You can use the "Constraints" addon to add constraints to rigid bodies, such as joints and collisions.
- You can use the "Constraints" addon to add constraints to rigid bodies, such as joints and collisions.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to use rigid body physics in Blender. You can use this technique to create a variety of simulations, such as falling objects, bouncing balls, and even explosions.
