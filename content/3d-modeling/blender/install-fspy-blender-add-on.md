### fSpy Blender Addo-on Installation Steps

## Install fSpy Blender Add-on Video Transcript

In this Blender tutorial I'm going to show you how to install the fSpy importer add-on for Blender. fSpy is a great image photo matching perspective software that can match photos in a 2d plane and then use that to make a camera in 3D. The problem is that fSpy makes all these numbers that you have to put for your camera position which you can copy manually but that's a lot of work. So the creators of fSpy have made an add-on for Blender that we can use.

And so, if you go to the fSpy Blender add-on site on GitHub we can click on the releases right here and we want to get this ZIP file. And we can download it and save it on our desktop. The next thing to do is to jump into Blender.

In Blender we can install different plugins and add-ons by going to edit - preferences. In the preferences we can click install. After we've clicked on install we can click the zip file that we want to do and we can click install add-on. Now we can find it, it automatically searches for this and then we can click enable. If you can't remember if you've installed fSpy or any other add-on, you can go in the search bar and type fSpy and you'll see it right here and you'll see that it is enabled. So now you're ready to use the fSpy Blender add-on.
