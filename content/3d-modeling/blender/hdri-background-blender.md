## How to Add an HDRI Background Environment in Blender

These Blender tutorials show you how to add an HDRI background environment to your scenes. HDRIs are a great way to add a photorealistic look to your renders, and they can also be used to create interesting lighting effects.

We will start by creating a new scene and adding a cube to the scene. Then, we will add an HDRI to the background using the World settings. Finally, we will adjust the settings of the HDRI to make it look the way we want.

You will be able to add an HDRI background environment to your scenes in Blender.

## What You Will Need

- Blender
- A computer
- An HDRI image file

## Instructions

1. Open Blender.
2. Create a new scene.
3. Add a cube to the scene by pressing `Shift`+`A` and selecting "Cube" from the menu.
4. Select the cube and go to the Properties Editor.
5. In the World settings, click on the "Environment Texture" node.
6. Click on the "Open" button and select an HDRI image file.
7. The HDRI will now be applied to the background of the scene.
8. To adjust the settings of the HDRI, go to the Properties Editor and click on the "Environment Texture" node.
9. You can change the settings of the HDRI to make it look the way you want.
10. Once you are finished adjusting the settings of the HDRI, press `F12` to render the scene.

## Tips

- Use the lowest resolution HDRI image for the level of detail needed in the scene to keep render times low.
- Experiment with different HDRI image files to create different looks for your scenes.
- Use this technique to add realistic and interesting HDRI backgrounds to your renders.
