Gaussian Splatting became more well known from a [Siggraph 2023 3D Gaussian Splatting Paper](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). It is a technique that overcomes some of the limitations of [photogrammetry](./photogrammetry-software.md) when creating 3D representations from photographic sources. Since the technology is relatively new, it is computationally intensive but will likely be a large part of the future of 3D modeling and representation
