What is a model? What is a 3D model? What is the difference between an analog and a digital 3D model? How does 2D sketching relate to 3D modeling?

## AI and the Metaverse

This article, _[The Pathway to the Metaverse Begins With 3D Modeling](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/425643)_, in _The Entrepreneur_ examines the upcoming metaverse and how 3D modeled assets will be essential for the metaverse to work. 3D modelers will need to create the 3D digital objects for now, but soon [AI-Artificial-Intelligence](../coding/ai-artificial-intelligence.md) will likely play a bigger role in the automatic creation of 3D digital objects. Currently AI is able to produce realistic 2D images and make crude 3D models from photographs. This capability will exponentially grow in the future.

## 3D Modeling Software

Software used for [3D-Modeling](3d-modeling-software.md) has multiple different types depending on the intended use of the 3D Model. Architects would use software that specializes in larger objects, photorealistic renderings and precise real world dimensions. A machinist or industrial designer would use more traditional CAD (Computer Aided Design) software that features precision, [Parametric-Modeling](parametric-modeling.md), and structural simulations. Animators would prefer software with animation timelines and tools that aid in character rigging and animation special effects.

### Approaching 3D Modeling

The whole point of 3D modeling is the design process how do we go from something that's in our head to actually make it into our model. We're less interested in mastering all the intricacies of a particular piece of software then we are about having good ideas and sound processes We want to have good concepts and things that are thought out in ideated upon and iterated on

We will start with analog tools and use those processes to refine our [sketches](../drawing/technical-sketching.md) before spending time in 3D models We want to quickly be able to output something and then test it

The testing of our ideas and concepts whether aesthetic or physical is important. We want to not have precious ideas and thoughts that good great if not let's do something else.

We will do tests and then evaluate and then do again.

### Physical Output from Digital 3D Models

Digital 3D models are great for visualization, simulation, VR, video games, and for archiving but are still not physical objects. [Laser Cutting](../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting/laser-cutting.md), [CNC](../digital-fabrication/cnc/cnc-basics.md) machining, [3D Printing](../digital-fabrication/3d-printing/3d-printing.md), vinyl cutting, and [Water Jet Cutting](../digital-fabrication/water-jet-cutting.md) are fabrication processes that create physical outputs and objects from digital 3D models.
