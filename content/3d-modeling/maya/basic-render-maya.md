## How to Create a Photo Swoop in Autodesk Maya and Export a Render Image

In this [Autodesk Maya ](./maya.md)tutorial, I will show you how to create a photo swoop quickly and easily. I will also show you how to export a render image of your scene.

## Step 1: Create a Photo Swoop

The first thing you need to do is create a photo swoop in Maya. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Go to the Poly Modeling shelf and select the "Plane" tool.
2. Click and drag in the viewport to create a plane.
3. Set the subdivisions of the plane to 1 by opening the Attribute Editor and going to the "Polyplane" tab.
4. Switch to Edge Mode by right-clicking and holding, then selecting "Edge Mode" from the menu.
5. Extrude the edges of the plane by pressing `Ctrl`+`E` and then clicking and dragging the mouse up.
6. Bevel the edges of the plane by holding `Shift` and right-clicking, then selecting "Bevel Edge" from the menu. Set the "Segments" to 4 and the "Fraction" to 0.5.
7. Scale the plane by pressing `R` and then dragging the mouse.
8. Smooth the plane by right-clicking and selecting "Smooth" from the menu. Set the "Divisions" to 2 or 3.

## Step 2: Add a Cube

Now that you have created a photo swoop, you can add a cube to your scene. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Go to the Poly Modeling shelf and select the "Cube" tool.
2. Click and drag in the viewport to create a cube.
3. Move the cube so that it is in front of the photo swoop.

## Step 3: Add Lights and Materials

Now that you have added a cube to your scene, you can add lights and materials. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Add a light by going to the Arnold menu and selecting "Create > Light > Area Light".
2. Move the light so that it is shining on the cube.
3. Set the intensity of the light by opening the Attribute Editor and going to the "Area Light Shape" tab.
4. Add a material to the cube by right-clicking on the cube and selecting "Assign New Material".
5. Select the "AI Standard Surface" material and click "OK".
6. Set the color of the material by opening the Attribute Editor and going to the "Phong" tab.

## Step 4: Export a Render Image

Now that you have created a photo swoop with a cube, you can export a render image of your scene. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Go to the Render menu and select "Render > Camera".
2. Select the "File" tab and enter a name for your render image.
3. Select the "Format" tab and select a format for your render image.
4. Click "Render" to export your render image.

**That's it! You have now created a photo swoop in Autodesk Maya and exported a render image of your scene.**

## Here are some additional tips:

- You can use this technique to create any size or shape of photo swoop.
- You can also use this technique to create a backdrop for any object that you want to render.
- You can add more detail to the photo swoop by adding edge loops and vertices.
- You can use different materials to create different looks for your photo swoop.
- You can use different lights to create different moods for your photo swoop.
