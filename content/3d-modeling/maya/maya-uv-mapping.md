### UV Mapping

UV mapping in [Maya](maya.md) is the process of assigning 2D coordinates to 3D objects. This is necessary so that textures can be applied to the objects in a way that is consistent and predictable.

When laying out your UVs, try to minimize distortion. This will help to ensure that the textures look good on the object.

The UV Editor is a powerful tool that can help you to UV map objects of any complexity. It is important to learn how to use the UV Editor effectively in order to produce high-quality UV maps. Use symmetry to your advantage. If your model is symmetrical, you can only UV map one half of it and then mirror the results to the other half. This can save you a lot of time.

## Basic UV Mapping Guide

Maya has a number of tools and features that make it easy to UV map your models. Here is a basic guide to UV mapping in Maya:

1. **Prepare your model.** Make sure that your model is clean and well-organized. This will make it easier to UV map. You may also want to consider using symmetry to simplify the process.
2. **Create UV shells.** UV shells are the basic building blocks of a UV map. They are 2D shapes that represent the different parts of your model. You can create UV shells manually or use one of Maya's automatic UV mapping tools.
3. **Unfold your model.** Once you have created your UV shells, you need to unfold them. This will flatten your model onto a 2D plane. You can use Maya's Unfold tool to do this.
4. **Layout your UV shells.** Once your model is unfolded, you need to layout your UV shells. This involves moving and resizing the shells so that they fit together efficiently and make best use of the texture space.
5. **Relax your UV shells.** Once you are happy with the layout of your UV shells, you can relax them. This will help to reduce any distortion in the UV map. You can use Maya's Relax tool to do this.
6. **Export your UV map.** Once your UV map is complete, you need to export it. This will create a file that you can use in your game engine or other software.
