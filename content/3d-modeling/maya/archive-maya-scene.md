## Make an Archive ZIP of Your Scene

After you create your scene. Archive the Maya scene with the Maya scene archiver. If you do not archive the scene, then texture files will not be attached and you will only have the model data. To archive your scene, with your scene open, go to File > Archive Scene. This will create a zip of your scene and any needed texture files. It will create a zip file in your Project's scenes folder. This video [shows how to archive a Maya scene](https://youtu.be/gic-kMWKjNI).
