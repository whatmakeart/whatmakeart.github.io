## Description:

In this Maya tutorial for beginners, I will show you how to model a simple block with a 90 degree cutout and a hole in the middle. This will all be able to have nice edge flow geometry and work with smoothing enabled.

## Steps:

1. Create a cube.
2. Translate the cube in the Z direction by 1.5 units.
3. Rename the cube to "block".
4. Add divisions to the cube.
5. Extrude the faces of the cube.
6. Add edge loops to the cube.
7. Circularize the components of the cube.
8. Extract the faces of the cube.
9. Delete the center object of the cube.
10. Move the edge loop of the cube.
11. Merge the vertices of the cube.
12. Add edge loops to the rings of the cube.
13. Bevel the edges of the rings of the cube.
14. Bevel the edges of the cube.
15. Straighten the edge loops of the cube.
