## How to Create an Infinite Photo Swoop in Autodesk Maya

In this [Autodesk Maya](maya.md) tutorial, I will show you how to create an infinite photo swoop quickly out of just a plane. This is a great way to create a realistic backdrop for your renders, and it's very easy to do.

Here are the steps:

1. Create a plane in Maya.
2. Switch to Edge mode.
3. Extrude the edges of the plane up.
4. Bevel the edges of the plane.
5. Scale the plane up.
6. Smooth the plane.

That's it! You've now created an infinite photo swoop in Autodesk Maya.

Here are some additional tips:

- You can adjust the subdivisions of the plane to create a smoother or rougher swoop.
- You can also add more edges to the plane to create a more complex swoop.
- Experiment with different settings to create the perfect backdrop for your renders.
