[Maya](./maya.md) objects have a default Lambert shader applied by default. The base color of the Lambert shader can be customized to create different colors on objects.

Maya has a number of presets for the [aiStandardSurface shader](./maya-aistandardsurface.md). These presets will work for many basic materials and can form a good foundation for creating custom materials and textures.
