How do you cut a round hole in an object in Autodesk Maya? How can you cut into an object just on one side with a perfectly circular sized hole in Autodesk Maya? This tutorial will show you how to quickly cut a hole in any object in Autodesk Maya.

First, I'll select a cube, then under the attribute editor select pcube1.

I'll translate it up one unit. So now it is sitting on the grid.

Next select polyCube1 in the attribute editor of Autodesk Maya.

In the attribute Editor, add four subdivisions for the width four subdivisions, for the depth and two subdivisions, for the height, Right
click and select edge mode. Orbit around and then hold shift to select the edges that you want to use as your whole. Once I have these edges selected, hold shift right click circularize components. Now this is circularized?

Press Q to escape out of the menu. Then hold right mouse button and go to face mode. Select each of these faces. Then we're going to extrude. Press Ctrl or command E to extrude. We need to use the offset command.

Hold Ctrl while you are dragging with your left mouse button to get a more even offset.

Now that it is offset, we can press G to repeat the extrude. we can go down a little bit. Press G to repeat the extrude again.

Now we're making the hole. Press G one more time to repeat the extrude.

Press G again and this time we'll use offset while holding the Ctrl key to inset that face.

Press Q to escape out of the command. Then in Autodesk Maya if you press three goes into smooth mode.

And if I orbit around you can tell that this is a perfectly round hole in this cube. I'll go back to one.

So now we can go ahead and add some holding edges.

Hold shift right mouse button to get the multi cut tool.

If I hold the control button then I can go ahead and snap right on the edges.

And if I hold shift then it'll give me snapping on certain percentages.

I can orbit around hold control and shift and snap right where I want that to be.

If I press three now, you can see that it has all of these holding edges.

Right click to go to object mode.

Press Q to escape out of the Multi cut tool.

Then hold shift, right click and smooth the object.

Once can off click If you orbit around you can tell that this is a really nice subdivided hole in an object in Maya.

So hopefully this allows you to cut holes in objects that are perfectly round on just one side of an object in Autodesk Maya.

Happy 3D modeling!
