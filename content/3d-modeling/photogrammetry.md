Photogrammetry uses multiple 2D images takes from different yet overlapping angles to create a 3D mesh with textures. To achieve the highest detail and most accurate 3D model from the real world, [3D scanning](./3d-scanning.md) is recommended.

## Photogrammetry Best Practices

- Keep the object in focus. Ensure that the aperture of your camera is small enought to have a wide depth of field. A high F-stop such as F-22, which has a small aperture, will give a deep depth of field.
- Use a high shutter speed.
- Refer to [basic camera settings](../photography/basic-camera-settings.md) for more information about setting up a camera for photogrammetry.
- Add multiple scale references. Lay down rulers, markers and other scale calibration devices near the object or location to scan. Make sure to capture the scale devices in detail so they can be used to tell the software what the real world scale and dimensions are. It is best to use long scale distances to improve accuracy. If you lay down a 2 meter measuring stick, then use the full 2 meters to set scale, rather than just a few millimeters or centimeters, even if the object is small.
