Respond to the following about your project.

1. Were you able to ssemble your project? If so, how did it go? If not, what obsticals remain?
2. Is you project made of more permanent materials, or if made of temporary materials such as cardboard, does it have an intentional designed form? and fastening methods should be used.
3. Are components, sensors, motors, relays, buttons, securely attached in the locations that make sense? Is wiring length modified to accomodate component placement?
4. Are connectors used to allow you to "disconnect" longer wires from component boards so you can disassemble and transport your project?
5. What is your overall assessment of your project?
6. What would you do differently and why?
7. What are remaining unknowns?
8. What do you know now that you did not know at the start of the project?
9. Did you use an LLM? How did you use it? What worked and what did not?
