## Assignment Deliverables

- 5-10 second video of LED Strip running FastLED Demo Code
- Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname LED Strip Wiring.mp4 (mp4, mv4, mov)

## Overview

LEDs are fun to control but if you use individual LEDs then your microcontrollwer will quickly run out of GPIO pins. Addressable LEDs overcome this limitation by sending a signal through all of the LEDs that tells each individual LED what color and brightness to operate at. This usually only requires 1 to 2 wires.

Using the [fastLED library examples](../../../../arduino/arduino-fast-led.md), enter the correct LED protocol, LED pin number on the Arduino, and the number of LEDs. We are using strips of 7 LEDs that work with WS2811 protocol using only 1 data line.
