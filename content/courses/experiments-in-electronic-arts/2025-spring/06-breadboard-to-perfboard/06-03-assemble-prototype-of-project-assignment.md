## Assignment Deliverables

1. Physical prototype of project with as many components working as possible. Function and proof of concept demonstrations are more important that looks or appearance.

## Assignment Overview

Testing components in isolation can only go so far. Eventually a project needs to be assembled at scale with multiple components to see how everything is working together. Eventully a project prototype has a deadline. This is a good time to test a prototype.

- Assemble your project with as many of the parts as possible.
- The physical structure of the project should be moving away from tape and cardboard. More permanent materials and fastening methods should be used.
- Components, sensors, motors, relays, buttons, should be securely attached in the locations that they will be in the final project.
- Longer wires will be needed to connect the electronic components
- It is important that you can "disconnect" longer wires from component boards so you can disassemble and transport your project.
