## Assignment Deliverables

1. Upload a 5-10 second video of relay module operating a load, controlled by a microcrontroller (`.mp4`)
   - Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Relay Wiring.mp4

## Overview

Relays are essential for controlling high power device with a microcontroller. It is important to understand how to hook up a load to a relay so it is electrically isolated from the low voltage circuits of the microcontroller to prevent damage.
