### Breadboards

A breadboard allows simple and quick electrical connections between the Arduino and electronic components like resistors and LEDs. It is used for prototyping since the connections are temporary unlike soldered connections. Breadboards usually have two power rails running down the sides and then two rows of 4 connected pins for laying out components.
