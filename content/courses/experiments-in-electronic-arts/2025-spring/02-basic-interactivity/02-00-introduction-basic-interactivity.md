This module introduces user input and feedback. Previously we programmed the Arduino to blink an LED or move a servo motor, but once the program started it merely continued without responding to changes from the user or the environment. To make something interactive it needs to react to user input, the environment, or both. A button and a potentiometer can capture user input and change the actions of the program.

As programs begin to have multiple parts, functions, and actions it is beneficial to break complex ideas into discrete component parts of a whole.
