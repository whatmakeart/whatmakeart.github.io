## Overview

Signal wires are an excellent and reliable way to send information from sensors to an Arduino or from an Arduino to a device, but eventually there is a practical limit to the length of wires.Even before length limits are reached, wires may be undesirable due to a project design that involves moving parts or a weather station in a hard to reach location. Wireless communication is common in everyday life and can also be used with microcontrollers to expand the communication capabilities in electronics projects.
