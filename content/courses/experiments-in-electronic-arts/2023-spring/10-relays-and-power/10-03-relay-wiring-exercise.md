## Assignment Deliverables

- 5-10 second video of relay module operating a load, controlled by the Arduino
- Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Relay Wiring.mp4 (mp4, mv4, mov)

## Overview

Relays are essential for controlling high power device with a microcontroller. It is important to understand how to hook up a load to a relay so it is electrically isolated from the low voltage circuits of the microcontroller to prevent damage.
