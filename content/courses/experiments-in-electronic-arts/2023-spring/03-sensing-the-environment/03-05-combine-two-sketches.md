## Assignment Deliverables

- Arduino .ino file. This is the saved sketch file from the Arduino IDE of the combined sketches.
- Photo of the electronics hooked up on the breadboard of the combined sketches
- 5-10 second video of everything working or if code doesn't compile a video of it not working

Do your best. It may not work and there may be errors that you cannot fix. That is ok but give it valid attempt.

## Assignment Overview

Now that we have multiple different sensors lets look at how we can [combine two Arduino Sketches](../../../../arduino/combine-two-arduino-sketches.md).

Pick two of the example sketches we worked with so far in the course. It is bet to use these examples that don't use the `delay();` function.

- Arduino Fade
- Arduino Blink Without Delay
- Arduino Button Debounce
- Servo Knob Without Delay
- Microphone control LED
- NewPing Library Ultrasonic Sensor
