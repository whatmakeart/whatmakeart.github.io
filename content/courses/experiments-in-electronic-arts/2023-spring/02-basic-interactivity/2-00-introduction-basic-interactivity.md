This module introduces user input. Previously we programmed the Arduino to blink an LED or move a servo motor, but once the program started it just continued without changing. To make something interactive it needs to react to user input, the environment, or both. A button and a potentiometer will be used to capture user input and change the actions of the program.

## Learning Objectives

- Connect a potentiometer to analog pin of Arduino
- Connect a button to digital pin of Arduino
- Control a servo motor with a potentiometer
- Control a LED with a button
- Use a millisecond timer to debounce a button
- Incorporate user input into an interactive sculpture

## Keywords / Terms

- button
- potentiometer
