## Assignment Deliverables

- 5-10 second video of LED Strip running FastLED Demo Code
- Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname LED Strip Wiring.mp4 (mp4, mv4, mov)

## Overview

LEDs are fun to control but if you use individual LEDs then your microcontrollwer will quickly run out of GPIO pins. Addressable LEDs overcome this limitation by sending a signal through all of the LEDs that tells each individual LED what color and brightness to operate at. This usually only requires 1 to 2 wires.

Using the fastLED library examples, enter the correct LED protocol, LED pin number on the Arduino, and the number of LEDs. We are using strips of 7 LEDs that work with WS2811 protocol using only 1 data line.

## Parts Needed

<div class="responsive-table-markdown">

| Part                | Quantity |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Arduino             | 1        |
| 5v LED Strip        | 1        |
| 5v Power Supply     | 1        |
| Barrel Jack Adapter | 1        |
| Jumper Wires        | ~ 7      |
| Crimp Connectors    | 3-4      |

</div>

### Recommended Additional Parts

The capacitor and resistor added to the circuit follows the best practices for using a LED strip with an Arduino.

<div class="responsive-table-markdown">

| Part                  | Quantity |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| 500-1000 µF capacitor | 1        |
| 330 ohm Resistor      | 1        |

</div>

## Process

1. Solder 22AWG or 28 AWG stranded wire to the 3 solder pads on the start end of the LED strip. THis is the side that the arrows are pointing away from.
2. (Optional but recommended) Solder a 330 ohm resistor between the LED strip Data line and the pin of the Arduino.
3. (Optional but recommended) Solder a 500-1000 µF capacitor across the + positive and - negative solder pads on the LED strip. The grey stripe on the capacitor identifies the negative pin.
4. Attach a "Dupont" style pin terminal to the end of the Data In wire. This type of connector is attached with a crimper and looks like the end of the standard "jumper wires". You can also use a ferrule crimp terminal if you attach a screw terminal block to the Arduino. (The example uses a screw terminal block on the Arduino.) This will be the pin number for the Data line in the example sketches.
5. Strip ~ 1 cm of the opposite end of the wire coming from the DC+ solder pad of the LED strip. Attach a ferrule crimp to the stripped end. Connect this Ferrule crimp to the + positive screw terminal of the DC barrel jack adapter.
6. Cut the "innie" end off a black "outie to innie" jumper cable. Strip ~ 1cm of wire from the cut end. Strip ~ 1 cm of the opposite end of the wire coming from the DC- solder pad of the LED strip. Twist the striped jumper wire and the stripped LED strip wire together. Attach a ferrule crimp to the twisted together stripped ends. Connect this Ferrule crimp to the - negative screw terminal of the DC barrel jack adapter.
7. Attach the "outie" end of the black jumper wire to a GND pin of the Arduino.
8. Attach the barrel jack adapter to a 5v power source.
9. Use one of the example sketches from the FastLED library. (If you do not have the FastLED library installed, go to the library tab in the Arduino IDE and search for FastLED).
10. Take a short video of the LED demo lights.

### FastLED Demo Reel Sketch

Make sure to change the `DATA_PIN` value in the sketch to the pin you are using on the Arduino. The sketch below already updated the `LED_TYPE` to WS2811 and the `NUM_LEDS` to 7.

```C
#include <FastLED.h>

// of the kinds of animation patterns you can quickly and easily
// compose using FastLED.
//
// This example also shows one easy way to define multiple
// animations patterns and have them automatically rotate.
