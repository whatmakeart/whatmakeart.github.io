## Assignment Deliverables

- 1/2 page to 1 page summary of current status of project that highlights what is finished, what needs to be completed, and a planned schedule of action (.docx or .pdf)

## Assignment Overview

Write a summary of what has occurred so far in the project. Evaluate what parts are worth keeping and what parts are no longer important. What new components have become relevant?

This is the last in progress check in before the final discussion and critique.

Be thoughtful and objective with your assessment. What parts from your last progress report did you complete? Which parts are still missing?

This will be a checklist for you to complete your project.
