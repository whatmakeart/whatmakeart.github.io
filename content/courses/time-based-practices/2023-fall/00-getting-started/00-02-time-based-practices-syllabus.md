title: 00.02 Time Based Practices Syllabus
---

## Course description

This course investigates the concepts and practices of various time‐based media arts. This involves an introduction to artmaking as a process involving transactions between people, objects, technologies, and sites. Presentations focus on a range of contemporary artists and consider characteristics of recent production including simultaneity, immersion, duration, a collapsing of the distinction between art and life, and a realignment of the relationship between audience and artwork. A series of workshops explore a fundamental introduction to the processes of video art, sound art, media installation, 3D modeling and visualization, and digital fabrication. Knowledge and skills learned from experiments in workshops serve as the basis to produce several projects. The development of media literacy, media ethics, and dissemination techniques drive and ground the assignments. The course reinforces and emphasizes the production of high-quality documentation of time-based and ephemeral artwork for presentation at venues, portfolios, and proposals.

## Learning Objectives

Students will have the opportunity to:

- Examine the intricacies of using and integrating digital technologies in fine art practices.
- Identify and discuss the history and theory associated with artists experimenting with digital and analog media.  
- Extend their skills with the software used to produce projects, including the Adobe Creative Suite, CNC toolpath software, 3D modeling software and other software oriented towards media art production and experimentation.  
- Produce creative projects by combining complex interdisciplinary processes.
- Describe and demonstrate complicated digital file management and workflows.  
- Employ a multidisciplinary approach to the subject and content of a given project.  
- Develop a pattern of self‐learning and troubleshooting electronic and digital technology.  
- Apply video sequencing, sound sequencing, web media, 3D Modeling and digital fabrication toward creative production.
- Illustrate and create sketches, project plans, concept visualizations of project ideation using digital 3D modeling tools and image editors, and analog techniques.
- Operate digital cameras and microphones to capture high quality, visual documentation video and photographs of completed projects.
- Use image editing and video editing software to produce images and video for presentation
