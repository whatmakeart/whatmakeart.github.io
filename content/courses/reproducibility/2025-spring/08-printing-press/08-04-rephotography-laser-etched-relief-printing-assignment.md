## Assignment Deliverables

1. A unique, singular work of Rephotography from an appropriated image
2. An edition of the same appropriated image made with relief printing or intalio printing

## Assignment Overview

Create a 2D matrix that will produce the same image in a new form over and over.
Once transferred from the original image to the plate and then to the pulled print the image is transformed in the reproduction.

What does it mean in context to transform a photographic image through all these steps?
What makes something singular versus and edition?

## Potential Investigations

1. Pull a print with the bare wood before applying any sealer such as shellac. You can do this when testing the printing press preassure. It often creates a uniqu "mono-print" with the residue of the laser etching and wood material visiable in the print.
2. What happens to the image if it is transformed into thread and fabric on a digital embroidery machine?
3. Can you reproduce the image with 3D printing using AI 3D mesh generative tools to create a 3D version of the image?
