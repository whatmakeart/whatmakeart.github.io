Slip cast forms can be joined together simply by painting on some wet slip to each piece to be joined. Then press the pieces together while rubbing slight back and forth to ensure good adhesion.

**Do you need to score the clay?**

Since slip creates a uniform grain structure, scoring is not needed like it is when joint clay thrown on the wheel, or sculpted clay. While not strictly necessary, scoring the clay can help make a better joint.
