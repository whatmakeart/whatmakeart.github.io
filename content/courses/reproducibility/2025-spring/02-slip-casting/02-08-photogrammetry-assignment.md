## Assignment Deliverables

1. Upload `.obj` file of photogrammetry scan
2. Upload texture image file from photogrammetry scan (.jpg or .png)
3. Upload `.mtl' file of photogrammetry scan
4. Upload render image from Blender or Maya of Photogrammetry scan (.jpg or png)

## Process

1. Select an object for photogrammetry. This can be the original object that you made a mold of or a pulled slip-cast of from the mold.
2. Set you object on an approximately waist hig platform in a bright but flatly lit room. If a well lit room with even lighting is not available, then noon on a cloudy day outside works well.
3. Capture the object for photogrammetry:
   - Each part of the object must be taken from a minimum of two angles with overlapping infomation from other images.
   - A video from 360 degrees around the object. One pass should be a low angle, one pass should be perpendicular, and one pass should be from a high angle. Move steady, keeping the object in focus.
   - A series of photos taken from around the object works well. Fill the frame and make sure the object is in focus. One 360 pass from a low angle, one from perpendicular, and one from a high angle. You can take additional detail shots from closer in.
4. Use photogrammetry software to create a textured 3D mesh of your object.
5. Download the prepared render scene for Blender.
6. Import the mesh into Blender.
7. Scale and position the object on the virtual pedestal.
8. Clean up the mesh of unwated parts as needed.
9. Adjust the camera and lights.
10. Render and save an image.
