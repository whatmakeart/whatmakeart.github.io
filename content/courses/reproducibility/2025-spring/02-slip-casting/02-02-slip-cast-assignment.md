## Assignment Deliverables

- 15 Slipcast copies of an object pulled from a plaster slip cast mold of that object

## Overview

Imagine that you are an alien visitor arriving on earth long after humans have disappeared. You find sewer covers, drywall screws, plastic bottles, toys, and many other manufactured items. What could you learn about humanity from just these items if nothing else remained? What information is implicit in the existence of a drywall screw? It is made of hard brittle steel with a specially formed bugle top in order to not cut the paper covering of gypsum drywall. From these observations, alien archeologists could learn a lot about building construction and the everyday lives of the humans that inhabited those structures.

For this assignment you will select a mass produced object, preferably one that used casting or a mold in its production.
