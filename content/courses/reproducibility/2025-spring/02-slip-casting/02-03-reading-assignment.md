### Text Source

- Benjamin, Walter. [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm) 1936. Translated by Harry Zohn. [maxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/) [(Archive Link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240418175200/https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm) or [web.mit.edu](https://web.mit.edu/) [(Archive Link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240622141032/https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/benjamin.pdf)

## Process

Read the text once without worrying too much about parts you don’t fully understand. If something strikes you as interesting or unusual, jot it down. Mark passages you agree or disagree with, and note your reasons why. Remember that truly understanding a text often requires more than one reading. Rereading helps you internalize the content and develop your own opinions.

The main goal of this assignment is to ensure you have meaningful, well-formed thoughts that you can clearly communicate to others. How you reach that point is largely up to you: you can read thoroughly, take notes according to the assignment guidelines, or even consult large language models (LLMs) for prompts and ideas. However, using external tools can be both helpful and distracting, so use them wisely.

Above all, remember that your ability to form, remember, and express creative analyses is more valuable than the notes or writing response you produce. Think of reading and note-taking (or using any tool) as a means to an end: what ultimately matters is that you can share novel insights and participate effectively in the in-class discussion, where you’ll be evaluated on the originality and clarity of your ideas.

## LLM Completed Examples

Do your best to get good at things that machines are not. Writing a response to a reading is a solved problem, so don't maximize for that skill. Rather, maximize for creative and critical thought. One way to do that is to analyze texts with all available tools, including LLMs, and then challenge your assumptions through dialogue and debate with others.

The race to create text is over before you even begin.

2. **Mechanical Reproduction** - The process by which art and media are duplicated using technology, such as printing or film, diminishing their “aura.”
3. **Cult Value** - The value of art derived from its ritual or religious significance, as opposed to its exhibition value in public spaces.

### **Reflection and Notes**

Reading Benjamin’s essay emphasized how art's function has shifted from ritualistic and cult-like to widely disseminated and politically charged. His notion of “aura” challenges how we perceive authenticity in today’s context, particularly when images, videos, and digital creations are endlessly replicated and shared.

This reading pushed me to think critically about how new technologies (such as AI) continue to reshape our cultural and artistic landscape, both democratizing access and raising questions about the value of originality.
