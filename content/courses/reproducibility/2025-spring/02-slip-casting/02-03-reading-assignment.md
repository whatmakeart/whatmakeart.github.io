## Process

Read the text once without worrying too much about parts you don’t fully understand. If something strikes you as interesting or unusual, jot it down. Mark passages you agree or disagree with, and note your reasons why. Remember that truly understanding a text often requires more than one reading. Rereading helps you internalize the content and develop your own opinions.

The main goal of this assignment is to ensure you have meaningful, well-formed thoughts that you can clearly communicate to others. How you reach that point is largely up to you: you can read thoroughly, take notes according to the assignment guidelines, or even consult large language models (LLMs) for prompts and ideas. However, using external tools can be both helpful and distracting, so use them wisely.

Above all, remember that your ability to form, remember, and express creative analyses is more valuable than the notes or writing response you produce. Think of reading and note-taking (or using any tool) as a means to an end: what ultimately matters is that you can share novel insights and participate effectively in the in-class discussion, where you’ll be evaluated on the originality and clarity of your ideas.

## LLM Completed Examples

Do your best to get good at things that machines are not. Focus on developing the skills that make you uniquely human—skills that machines can’t yet easily replicate. Tasks like summarizing a reading or generating straightforward responses have become easily completable by technology, like large language models (LLMs).

Instead of aiming to perfect skills that are now routine for machines, strive to maximize your capacity for creative thinking and critical analysis. Look at texts, ideas, and problems from multiple perspectives and engaging with them deeply and thoughtfully. Use all the tools at your disposal, including LLMs, to analyze texts, uncover patterns, and generate insights. Question the conclusions you’ve drawn and test your ideas through dialogue, debate, and collaboration with others.

The race to simply create text is over before you even start—it’s a challenge machines have already nearly mastered. What matters now is what you bring to the process: your ability to challenge assumptions, navigate complexity, and offer nuanced perspectives that machines cannot.

His notion of “aura” challenges how we perceive authenticity in today’s context, particularly when images, videos, and digital creations are endlessly replicated and shared.

This reading pushed me to think critically about how new technologies (such as AI) continue to reshape our cultural and artistic landscape, both democratizing access and raising questions about the value of originality.
