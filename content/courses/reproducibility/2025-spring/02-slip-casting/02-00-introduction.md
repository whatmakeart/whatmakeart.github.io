## Overview

This module continues the investigation of mold, making and slip casting as a means of reproducing objects. A mold is a negative representation of the space the object previously occupied. By pouring ceramic slip into the cavity of the mold and then pulling out a cast, the object is reproduced. Is it the same object? Of course not. Students will investigate what of the object remains and what is lost and perhaps what is gained through the transformation and reproduction of objects through slipc asting.

In preparation for making mock-up displays to test out display methods of objects, students investigate reproducibility through photography and 3D rendering. Photogrammetry can take photographs which are themselves reproductions of an object and then reconstruct the object and digital 3D space along with textures. This three-dimensional model can be added to a scene with virtual lights to produce a render. Through the ubiquitous digital tool of copy and paste, many of the same object can be reproduced digitally and rendered virtually to test out methods of display of object multiples.

## Learning Objectives

- Pull a slip cast from a plaster mold
- Pull repeated casts from a mold
- Create a textured 3D model of an object with photogrammetry
- Render an image of a 3D model with virtual lighting
- Examine reproducibility in at through a reading of _Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction_ by Walter Benjamin
