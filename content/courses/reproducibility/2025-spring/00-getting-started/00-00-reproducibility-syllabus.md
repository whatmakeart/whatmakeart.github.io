## Course Description

Though we often think of artworks as unique, this is not an intrinsic or inherent quality of the work itself, but the result of the choice of media. Consequently, since the Renaissance and the advent of Printmaking, the printing press, and bronze casting, multiplicity and reproduction have been a part of Western culture. The machine age, photo-reproduction, lithography, industrial standardization, modularity, fabrication, and multiplicity became part of artistic practice. Prints, posters, ready-mades, objects, books, comics, and designed utilitarian objects editions, multiples, modules, and reproductions are now a significant aspect of contemporary art making which abandons the notion of the unique work. Making works of this kind requires the artist to take into consideration how the act of reproduction, or replication constitutes part of their workâ€™s form and content. Pre-requisite: VAT 200
