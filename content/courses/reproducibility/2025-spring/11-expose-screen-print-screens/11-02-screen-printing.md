Check out a screen and sign the screen print loan agreement / contract.

Inks are kept in a cabinet labeled "Reproducibility."

Since we are printing on paper be careful not to select a fabric ink since it has a dryer in it.

Different Screens have different size meshes, the size of the holes of the grid or crisscrossed strands. A #180 - #195 screen is good for using with photo emulsion and basic inks. This is equivalent to dots per inch (DPI) of screen printing resolution. For printing on glass or ceramics, a courser screen may be more ideal.

1. Degrease the screen. Any grease or residue on the screen can inhibit the adhesion of the photo emulsion. It is good practice to clean and degrease the screen before applying emulsion, especially in a shared shop with a borrowed screen of unknown grease content.
