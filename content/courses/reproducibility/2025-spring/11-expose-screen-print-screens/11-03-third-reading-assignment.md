## Process

Read the text once without worrying too much about parts you don’t fully understand. If something strikes you as interesting or unusual, jot it down. Mark passages you agree or disagree with, and note your reasons why. Remember that truly understanding a text often requires more than one reading. Rereading helps you internalize the content and develop your own opinions.

The main goal of this assignment is to ensure you have meaningful, well-formed thoughts that you can clearly communicate to others. How you reach that point is largely up to you: you can read thoroughly, take notes according to the assignment guidelines, or even consult large language models (LLMs) for prompts and ideas. However, using external tools can be both helpful and distracting, so use them wisely.

Above all, remember that your ability to form, remember, and express creative analyses is more valuable than the notes or writing response you produce. Think of reading and note-taking (or using any tool) as a means to an end: what ultimately matters is that you can share novel insights and participate effectively in the in-class discussion, where you’ll be evaluated on the originality and clarity of your ideas.
