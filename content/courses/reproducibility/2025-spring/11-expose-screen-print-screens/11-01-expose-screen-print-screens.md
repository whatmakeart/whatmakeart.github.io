When starting out, Screen printing works better with thicker bolder lines that won;t allow the screen to clog with ink. For this assignment it offers a foil to the digital process on the reverse side of the zine.

Note that in screen printing, unlike relief printing, what you se is what you get or right is right. This means that you do not need to reverse or mirror your image, thye film you use to expose your screen should be placed on the screen as it will be printed. You should be able to read any text in the image.

1. Place your screen on the exposure bed, frame side up. This is how the screen will be orientated when screen printing.
2. Place your transparent film with your desired image on top of the screen. Should be placed the "right" way. A good rule of thumb is to keep everything ~1" fro mthe edges.
3. Place the rope from the exposure unit so it goes into the vacum area and also passed out the front so it is easier to lift the lid when finished.
4. Close the lid of the exposure bed.
5. Turn on the lights and set a timer for 4 minutes.
6. When 4 minutes is up, turn off the exposure bed. There is only about a 20 second window so be precise as possible with timing.
7. Remove your screen and film.
8. Bring the screen to the sink to wash out the unexposed emulsion.
9. The emulsion should be washed out soon after exposure.
10. Put your screen in the washout sink and spray it back and forth, top to bottom, about 6 times on each side to wash out the emulsion.
11. Hold the screen up to the light to make sure that all of the emulsion is removed in the unexposed areas. Wash out any remaining emulsion in the sink. Be careful not to wash too much or too aggressivley or you may damage the image.
12. Place your screen in front of the fan to dray for ~15 minutes each side.
13. The emulsion is still in a soft gelatin stage. It needs to be cured and hardened before screen printing. Place the dry screen back on the exposure bed and then expose it for another 4 minutes. The screen can be exposed outside in daylight but it takes longer and is not as predictable.
14. Turn off the water.
15. Double check that you turned off the water.
