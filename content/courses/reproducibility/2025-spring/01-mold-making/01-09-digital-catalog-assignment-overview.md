## Assignment Overview

Each week during the semester you should document the activities in your studio. You can record video, take photographs, make drawings, write down descriptions, and any other means of documentation. Take more documentation than you think you will need, you can edit later.

This assignment is **due weekly**. Some weeks may have specific prompts, such as reading responses or photo documentation of work, but all weeks require documentation of what occurred in the studio.

## Process

1. Take photos of everything you do in the studio. Try to vary the type of photograph. Use a tripod or another object with a photo timer to occasionally have photos of you in the studio.
2. Write down what you plan to do in the studio at the beginning of the week.
3. At the end of the week comment on what you accomplished. Explain which parts went according to plan and which parts did not work out.
4. Include in progress and working sketches of projects you are working on.

### Acceptable File Formats

- While images, video,and other media my be included in the Digital Catalog, writing assignments should be formatted as `.docx` or `.pdf` It is best to type any hand written notes directly in the document. At a minimum handwritten notes should be clearly scanned an included as an inline image in the document
- Avoid photographing documents. use a scanner to capture well exposed and in focus scans of works on paper.
- Export any video files as `.mp4` with the h.264 compression codec.
- Images can be included as `.png` or `.jpg`. PNG is a "lossless" file format and will create a larger file size than a compresses "lossy" JPG.

### Additional Writing to Include

- notes that you take in class about technical processes, critique feedback, assignment information, and any other information you write down
- writing about your ideations. While ideations are often visual sketches, it is also important to ideate via writing and at a a minimum to write down what your sketches are of, swo your future self can remember
- Responses to assignment readings and reflections on other course related reading you do during the semester.
- All other related and relevant items to your engagement with the course not listed above

## End of Semester Digital Catalog Presentation / Submission

Organize all of the weekly studio progress reports, assignments, writings, and other relevant materials into a single presentable document. This should be a PDF, and can contain links to online content such as video or interactive media. The documentation should be easily reviewable and contain text explanation of what is displayed.
