Gel medium transfer is a process that allows for the transfer of ink based imagery on paper to be transferred to a transparent gel medium for use in other applications such as collage or assemblage.

It works best with uncoated paper such as newsprint, laser prints, or photo copies. Inkjet prints do not work well.

Some papers will crinkle more than others with the application of moisture so it can be helpful to either tape the paper down or to use spray adhesive to attach it to a nonporous substrate such as glass or acrylic.
