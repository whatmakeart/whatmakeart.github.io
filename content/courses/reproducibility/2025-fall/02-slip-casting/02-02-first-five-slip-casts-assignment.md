## Assignment Deliverables

- Minimum of 5 Slip cast copies of an object pulled from a plaster slip cast mold of that object
  - Bring all pulled slip casts to class, even those that break

## Overview

Review the [slip casting](02-01-slip-casting.md) instructions from class and from this module. Remember that you can pull up to three slip casts from your mold per day and then you need to let the plaster dry.

If you want to modify your slip casts later, or combine the clay into modular built forms, then you need to work with clay that is the same level of wetness. To keep your slip casts from drying out, wrap them in plastic or put them in a sealed plastic food container.
