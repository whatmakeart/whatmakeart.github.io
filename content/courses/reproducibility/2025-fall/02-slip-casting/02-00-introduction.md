## Overview

This module continues the investigation of 2-part plaster mold making and slip casting as a means of reproducing found objects. A mold is a negative representation of the space the object previously occupied. By pouring ceramic slip into the cavity of the mold and then pulling out a cast, the object is reproduced. Is it the same object? Of course not but its form is related to the original. Students will investigate what of the object remains and what is lost and perhaps what is gained through the transformation and reproduction of objects through slip casting.

In preparation for making mock-up displays to ideate and visualize potential display methods of multiple objects, students investigate reproducibility through photogrammetry and 3D rendering. Photogrammetry reconstructs an object in digital 3D space along with visual textures by stitching together multiple photographs from different angles of an object, which are themselves reproductions of an object. This three-dimensional model can be added to a scene with virtual lights to produce a render. Through the ubiquitous digital tool of copy and paste, many of the same object can be reproduced digitally and rendered virtually to test out methods of display of object multiples without the need to physically build every iteration.
