## Assignment Deliverables

1.  Written instruction containing the protocal needed to create the original reference image.
    - No label needed, submit as a reply to the discussion thread.
2.  One reproduced image per student based on each student's written protocol.
    - Specific file labels not needed, but pay attention to the discussion thread so you submit it in the correct reply.
3.  Original reference image.
    - Specific label not needed. Do not upload untill all other students have uploaded their photos to the thread.

## Assignment Overview

In computer science, if you run the same source code on two different machines, you generally expect the same result. In the physical world more stochasticity is at play. For this exercise, you are not just taking photos, you are writing a "program" for a classmate to execute. This investigates potential failure points of reproducibility such as ambiguity of language and algorithmic bias.

### Authoring the Protocol (The Source)

1.  Wander the building and find a specific, composition. It is best to avoid including people. It can contain people, but do not pose them, they must be incidental passersby, people working, or shadows. Avoid shooting directly into classrooms, offices with open doors, or situations where people reasonably expect privacy.
2.  Take the Reference photo.
3.  Write a strict, algorithmic set of text instructions that would allow a stranger to reproduce this image _exactly_ as possible without ever seeing your photo.
    - Bad Instructions:
      - Stand in the hallway and take a picture of the door.
    - Better Instructions:
      - Stand in the 2nd-floor east corridor. Place your heels against the third floor tile from the from the elevator door. Hold camera at exactly 150cm height. Tilt 10 degrees down. Focus on the door handle. Capture.
      - Hold your phone at eye level, in landscape orientation, so that the red fire extinguisher is in the bottom-right corner of the frame and the window frame touches the top edge of the image.
4.  Post your written protocol to the Canvas Discussion thread.

### Executing the Code (The Compiler)

1. Choose a classmate's thread.
2. Go to their location. Read their written protocol. Rely strictly on their text instructions.
3. Attempt to take the exact same image based on the text.
4. Post your "Reproduced" image as a reply to their thread. Include a short note describing:

- What was easy to follow.
- What was ambiguous, missing, or impossible to match.
- Any changes in the environment such as missing people, different lighting, or objects moved.

5. Repeat the process for each student's instructions.

### Difference Check

Compare the source photo with the reproduced photo. Think about and be prepared to discuss the exercise with the class.

- Did the protocols fully describe what you needed to know?
- Did the focal length or sensor of the device change the meaning?
- Did the source protocol fail due to bad instructions or did the "compiler" fail due to bad execution of the instructions?
- Where did you have to guess or make interpretive decisions?
- Compare the original and reproduced images. In what ways are they the same photograph? In what ways are they clearly different?
