Displaying multiples of an object or an artwork has different considerations than displaying a singular unique art object. Think about the difference between a rack of clothing of differnt sixe of the same kind of pants versus a specific outfit dsiplayed on a human form.

There are multiple strategies and techniques for displaying mutliple forms based on basic [design principles](../../../../art-faq/design.md). It can be advantagous to use proven methods of display and it can be good to dismiss traditional methods in favor of new potentially unproven methods.

Consider if you will:

- Use a grid?
- Use a shelf?
- A pile on the floor?
- Hanging from the ceiling?
- Use a pedestal?
- Use multiple pedestals?
