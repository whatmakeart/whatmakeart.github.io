## Assignment Deliverables

1. 2D Image from the Public Domain
   - Label file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname 2D Image (`.png`, `.jpg`)
2. Generated 3D Model File from 2D Image
   - Label file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Generated Model (`.glb`, `.obj`, `.3mf`, `.stl`)
3. 3D Print of the Generated Model

## Overview

Use a 2D to 3D Model generator to make a 3D model from a 2D public domain image. Make a 3D Print of this generated model as a method of [reproducibility](../01-mold-making/01-01-reproducibility-in-art.md). Once the model is 3D printed it can be printed again, and again, and again. Multiples can be printed simultaneously.
