## Overview

Once an installation plan and method is ideated, sketched, and decided, then the installation must be made in reality. Even if the works will be displayed in Augmented Reality or in a Virtual World, the installation infrastructure still must be fabricated. Student decide on their installation plans and use the Fab Studios to make any needed support structures for their planned display of multiples.

In preparation for the investigation of Rephotography and appropriation, students use a 2D to 3D mesh generator to transform 2D images into physical 3D prints.

## Learning Objectives

- Transform installation sketch ideas into a working physical installation of multiples
- Adapt installations plans and ideas based on available resources
- Use tools and equipment to fabricate installation devices
- 3D print a generated 3D mesh

## Keywords

- Fabricate
- Installation
