Channels tell the console which lights to send commands to or which lights to operate. The channels are then _patched_ to dimmers and multi channel devices such as movers and other DMX fixtures.

DMX has universes of 512 addresses. There can be multiple universes but each DMX universe has a maximum of 512.
