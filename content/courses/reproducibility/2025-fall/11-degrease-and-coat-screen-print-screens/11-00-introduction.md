## Overview

Students check out print screens and complete the loan agreement form. Review and sign the screen checkout contract, noting the fee for damaging the screen. This occurs if the screen is not cleaned properly, scratched or if the screen has a hole. If there is irreversible damage then the screen cannot be reclaimed and reloaned. Even though the screens should be properly cleaned upon return, since we cannot 100% know the state of a loaned screen, it is important to clean and degrease the screen before use, to ensure the best result.

Students then learn how to clean and degrease the screens in preparation for coating with photo emulsion. Once the screens are dry, students apply photo emulsion to their screens and place in the storage room to allow a minimum of 5 hours to dry.

After screen coating is completed then students discuss their zine mockups and transparency images with a focus on how the sequential images relate to the full screen printed image on the reverse.

## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate the proper technique for cleaning and degreasing a print screen to remove all contaminants.
- Apply a smooth, even coat of photo emulsion to a print screen using a scoop coater.
- Follow all safety and storage procedures for handling wet, emulsion-coated screens.
- Articulate the relationship between a zine's sequential images and the larger format image.
