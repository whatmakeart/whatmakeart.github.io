## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
Students prepare appropriated image files for laser etching and cutting. Tis process involves mirroring the image, converting int to grayscale, sending a print to the the Epilog laser cutters at the think\[box\]. Successful laser etching for printmaking requires the focusing of the laser and selecting the correct power settings in the Epilog Dashboard.

## Learning Objectives

- Prepare image file for laser etching/engraving
- Setup file to send to Epilog Laser Cutter
- # Place material in machine and focus laser
