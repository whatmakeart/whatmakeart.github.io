## Assignment Deliverables

1. A unique, singular work of Rephotography from an appropriated image
2. An edition of the same appropriated image made with relief printing or intaglio printing (minimum 3 identical copies)
3. Written description of the work and its intent (`.docx` or `.pdf`)
   - Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname rephotography work description

## Assignment Overview

## Assignment Process

1. Create a 2D matrix with laser engraving that will reproduce the same appropriated image in two distinct ways.
2. Produce one reproduction will be a singular, unique item.
   - Must be produced from the matrix.
   - A drawing, painting, or sculpture is not allowed. A variety of 2D and 3D work are fine but the artifact must be produced using the appropriated image passed through a matrix.
   - The technique used may be repeatable but it is not required.
   - Since working with a matrix implies repeatability, consider using unique, one of a kind materials to create a singular work.
   - Is there a connection or relationship between the production process and image's connotations, suggestive meaning, and denotations, literal interpretations?
3. Produce an additional reproduction that will be and edition of identical copies.
   - Must be produced from the matrix.
   - Process must be repeatable in a way that makes identical copies.
   - Produce a minimum of 3 identical copies, although more copies are allowed.
   - Think about the relationship of the number of copies produced and the content of the appropriated image.

## Questions to Consider

1. What does it mean in context to transform a photographic image through all these steps?
2. What makes something singular versus and edition?
3. Can authorship be removed from an image?
4. How does appropriation alter or not alter an image?

## Potential Investigations

1. Pull a print with the bare wood before applying any sealer such as shellac. You can do this when testing the printing press pressure. It often creates a unique "mono-print" with the residue of the laser etching and wood material visible in the print.
2. What happens to the image if it is transformed into thread and fabric on a digital embroidery machine?
3. Can you reproduce the image with 3D printing using 2D to 3D mesh generative tools to create a 3D version of the image?
