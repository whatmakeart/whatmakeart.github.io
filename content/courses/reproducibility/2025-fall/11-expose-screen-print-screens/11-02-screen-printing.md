Check out a screen and sign the screen print loan agreement / contract.

Inks are kept in a cabinet labeled "Reproducibility."

Since we are printing on paper be careful not to select a fabric ink since it has a dryer in it.

Different Screens have different size meshes, the size of the holes of the grid or crisscrossed strands. A #180 - #195 screen is good for using with photo emulsion and basic inks. This is equivalent to dots per inch (DPI) of screen printing resolution. For printing on glass or ceramics, a courser screen such as a #40 may be more ideal.
