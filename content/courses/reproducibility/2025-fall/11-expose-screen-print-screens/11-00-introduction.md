## Overview

Students check out silk screens and complete the loan agreement form. Student then learn how to clean and degrease the screens in preparation for coating with photo emulsion. Once the screens are dry, students apply photo emulsion to their screens and place in the storage room to allow a minimum of 5 hours to dry.

After screen coating is completed then students discuss their zine mockups and transparency images with a focus on how the sequential images relate to the full silkcreened image on the reverse.

- Apply a smooth, even coat of photo emulsion to a silk screen using a scoop coater.
