## Overview

Students refine their slip casting technique based on their notes from their first 5 slip casts. Kitbashing, or combining multiple modular forms together is presented as a way to create new forms from the simple yet repeatable slip casts. The afternoon glazing demo completes the wet clay instruction so reproduced slip casts can be put into the kiln for firing.

Students build on their 3D modeling and rendering skills by using photogrammetry captured 3d models of their slip casts to create 3D modeled ideations of different form combinations. This allows for quick experimentation and iteration of forms before transferring the ideas to physical slip casts that may be in limited supply.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of ceramic underglazes and glazes

- Use 3D modeling for ideation and iteration
- Combine multiple slip cast forms into a single object

## Key Terms
