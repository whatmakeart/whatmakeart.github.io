## Overview

Students refine their slip casting technique based on their notes from their first 5 slip casts. Kitbashing, or combining multiple modular forms together is presented as a way to create new forms from the simple yet repeatable slip casts. The afternoon glazing demo completes the wet clay instruction so reproduced slip casts can be put into the kiln for firing.
