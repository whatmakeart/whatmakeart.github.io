## Overview

Students discuss the [second reading](../08-printing-press/08-02-second-reading-assignment.md) in relation to the [Rephotography Project](./09-01-rephotography-laser-etched-relief-printing-assignment.md). Studio time involves completing series of prints and determining how they will be displayed.

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss the analysis and comparisons of the central claims, evidence, and assumptions from texts.
- Articulate points of agreement and disagreement supported by quotations or paraphrases directly from texts.
- Consider how process, material, and quantity transform the meaning of the appropriated image.
- Execute relief printmaking workflows demonstrating repeatability for an edition.
- Demonstrate deliberate variation for a singular piece derived from a matrix.
