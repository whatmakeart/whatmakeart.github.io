## Assignment Deliverables

1. A unique, singular work of Rephotography from an appropriated image
2. An edition of the same appropriated image made with relief printing or intaglio printing (minimum 3 identical copies)
3. Written description of the work and its intent (`.docx` or `.pdf`)
   - Label file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname rephotography work description

## Assignment Overview

Using an appropriated photographic image, design and laser-etch a 2D matrix capable of making a unique, singular artifact one-off, and a repeatable edition consisting of three or more identical impressions. Explore how process, materials, and quantity change the meaning of the same image.

The unique work must result from using the matrix, the laser etched plate, not a separate drawing or sculpture. The technique may be repeatable, but your materials or process must make it unique.

The unique artifact and edition of 3 identical prints will be displayed for critique.

### Assignment Process

1. Create a 2D matrix with laser engraving that will reproduce the same appropriated image in two distinct ways.
2. Produce one reproduction that is a a singular, unique item.
   - Must be produced from the matrix. A variety of 2D and 3D work are fine but the artifact must be produced using the appropriated image passed through a matrix.
   - The technique used may be repeatable but does not have to be.
   - Since working with a matrix implies repeatability, consider using unique, one of a kind materials to create a singular work.
3. Produce an additional reproduction that will be an edition of identical copies.
   - Must be produced from the matrix.
   - Process must be repeatable in a way that makes identical copies.
   - Produce a minimum of 3 identical copies, although more copies are allowed.
   - Think about the relationship of the number of copies produced and the content of the appropriated image.
4. Write a self-reflection and description of your process and final results

### Questions to Consider

1. Why this image? Why this process?
2. What does it mean in context to transform a photographic image through all these steps?
3. What makes something singular versus and edition? What changes, conceptually and materially?
4. Can authorship be removed from an image?
5. How does [appropriation](../06-moldmaking-critque-rephotography-intro/06-02-appropriation.md) alter or not alter an image?
6. Is there a connection or relationship between the production process and image's connotations, suggestive meaning, and denotations, literal interpretations?

### Potential Investigations

1. Pull a print with the bare wood before applying any sealer such as shellac. You can do this when testing the printing press pressure. It often creates a unique "mono-print" with the residue of the laser etching and wood material visible in the print.
2. What happens to the image if it is transformed into thread and fabric on a digital embroidery machine?
3. Can you reproduce the image with 3D printing using 2D to 3D mesh generative tools to create a 3D version of the image?
