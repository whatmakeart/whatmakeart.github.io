## Assignment Deliverables

## Overview

## Process

## Questions

1. **Does that mean I have to use different materials than my previous work?**
   No. You can use any materials. Across the planet you are likely not the only artist working in those materials. It may be a good idea to seek out different materials as a way to distinguish this project from previous work but it is not a requirement.
2. **Do I need to change the content of the work?**
   No. Many artists can explore form, space, portraiture, climate change, domesticity, and other topics in unique ways. It could be to your benefit to use this project as an opportunity to seek out new subject matter to make work that is more different than your recent work but it is not a requirement.
