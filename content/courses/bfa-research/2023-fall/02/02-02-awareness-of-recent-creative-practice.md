Recall that past 5 pieces of art that you created. Describe each of them noting the following:

1. Tile of work if any
2. Media of work
3. Size of work
4. Detailed visual description of the work. What does it look like? Does it have formal design elements? Rough? Smooth? Shiny? Write enough that someone who has not seen the piece would have a sense of what it looks like.
5. What is the intended content of meaning of the piece if any? What is the reason it was made?
6. Are you happy with the way the work was completed? Why or why not?
7. If you recreated the piece now, what would you do differently?
8. Add a representative image of the piece.

Repeat the following for 5 different pieces that you recently completed. Answer the prompts as directly, objectively, and honestly as you can.
