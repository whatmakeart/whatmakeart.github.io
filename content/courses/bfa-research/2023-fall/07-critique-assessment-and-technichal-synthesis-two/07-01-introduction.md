## Overview

You have just completed a project for class that incorporated new tools and techniques. It's important to take some time to reflect on your work and what you learned by completing a written self-assessment. The process of reflecting on your strengths, weaknesses, and areas for growth can be a valuable tool for art students. It can help you to identify your artistic goals, improve your artistic skills, and develop your critical thinking skills.

A self-assessment can help you to identify your goals and develop a plan for how you will achieve them. Once you are aware of your strengths and weaknesses, you can begin to focus on improving your skills in the areas where you need to grow. A self-assessment can help you to identify the specific skills and techniques that you need to work on. Self-assessment is a critical thinking process. It requires you to reflect on your work honestly and objectively. This can help you to develop your critical thinking skills, which are essential for artists.

Before beginning ideation on a second "technical synthesis" project, we will assess the outcomes of the first project.
