To complete a self-assessment, start by asking yourself some basic questions about your project. For example:

- What were my goals for this project?
- Did I achieve my goals?
- What did I learn about myself as an artist while working on this project?
- What would I do differently if I were to do this project again?

Once you have answered these questions, you can begin to reflect on your strengths and weaknesses. For example:

- What aspects of my work am I most proud of?
- What areas could I improve?
- What new skills or techniques did I learn while working on this project?

Finally, identify your goals for the future. What do you want to achieve as an artist in the next week, month, or year? How can you use your self-assessment to help you achieve those goals?

**Tools and Equipment**

- Did I choose a minimum of one item each from the "What?", "Heard Of?", and "Used Before" categories for tools and equipment?
- Did I research each item and record my findings?
- Did I plan a sequence of learning and making since some steps will need to come before others?
- Did I use the tools and equipment safely and appropriately?
- Did I troubleshoot any problems that arose?

**Skills and Techniques**

- Did I choose a minimum of one item each from the "What?", "Heard Of?", and "Used Before" categories for skills and techniques?
- Did I research each item and record my findings?
- Did I plan a sequence of learning and making since some steps will need to come before others?
- Did I demonstrate the skills and techniques accurately and proficiently?
- Did I troubleshoot any problems that arose?

**Artwork**

- Is the artwork complete and to the best of my ability?
- Does the artwork use at least six items from the "What?", "Heard Of?", and "Used Before" categories?
- Are the tools and techniques used in the artwork safe and appropriate?
- Is the artwork visually appealing and well-crafted?
- Does the artwork convey a clear idea or concept?

**Overall**

- Did I meet all of the requirements of the assignment?
- Did I challenge myself and learn new things?
- Am I proud of the artwork I created?

In addition to these general questions, you may also want to ask yourself more specific questions about your process and the challenges you faced. For example:

- What were some of the challenges I encountered while making this artwork? How did I overcome them?
- What did I learn about myself as an artist while working on this assignment?
- What would I do differently if I were to do this assignment again?

Taking the time to self-assess your work is an important part of the learning process. It allows you to identify your strengths and weaknesses, and to set goals for future improvement.
