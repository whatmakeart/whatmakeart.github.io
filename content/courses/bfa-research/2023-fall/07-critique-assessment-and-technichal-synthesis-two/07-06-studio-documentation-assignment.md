## Assignment Overview

The midpoint in the semester is an arbitrary distinction but it offers an opportunity for calibration and wayfinding. For the studio documentation assignment due on October 30th, reflect on your progress and work so far this semester. Give an overview of successes an failures.

We will start a new series of studio documentation assignments after returning from fall break.

## Process

- Take photos of everything you do in the studio. Try to vary the type of photograph. Use a tripod or another object with a photo timer to occasionally have photos of you in the studio.
- Write down what you plan to do in the studio at the beginning of the week.
- At the end of the week comment on what you accomplished. Explain which parts went according to plan and which parts did not work out.
- Include in progress and working sketches of projects you are working on.
