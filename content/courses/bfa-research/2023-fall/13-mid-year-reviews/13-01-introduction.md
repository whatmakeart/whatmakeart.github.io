## Overview

In a BFA program, forming a BFA Thesis Committee is a critical step. This committee, composed of faculty members and possibly external experts, provides vital oversight and guidance for the student's BFA project. The process involves not just selecting the committee but also ensuring their commitment and understanding of their roles. Regular communication with this committee is key, as it involves updating them with new work, artist statements, and arranging studio visits. This interaction is essential for meaningful feedback and support throughout the project's development, culminating in a successful midyear review. This collaboration ensures the project aligns with academic standards and personal artistic goals.

Students work on revised drafts of mid-year statements and prepare their work for installation and presentation at mid-years later in the week.
