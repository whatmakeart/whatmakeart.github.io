## Overview

Based on the analysis of [Sculpture + Expanded Media Technical Inventory Exercise](../04-technical-synthesis/04-02-sculpture-technical-inventory-exercise.md) students created ideations an project plans to use tools and techniques from the "What?", "Heard Of", and "Used Before" categories. Students share their ideations and receive peer feedback before beginning work in the studio. This module includes basic technical guides for many of the tools and processes from technical inventory. The selection of technical guides is based on in class discussion of student technical inventory exercises.

## Learning Objectives

- Present ideations and project ideas that synthesize multiple unknown tools and techniques
- Refine ideas based on peer feedback
- Research tools and techniques and begin work with new equipment and processes
