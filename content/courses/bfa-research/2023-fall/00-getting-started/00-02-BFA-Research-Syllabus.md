## Course Description

As an extension of the Visual Arts and Technology Environment’s goal that students develop the
ability to generate self-directed work, the Department of Sculpture seeks to provide each
student with the opportunity to develop the skills and knowledge to identify and sustain an
independent practice. This course is designed to increase student awareness of the current art
discourse and the ability to use that knowledge as a means of awareness within the production
of their own work. This educational process embraces a variety of approaches to basic problem
solving skills measured against the contemporary practices of the discipline. In cooperation with
a major-day faculty, students are expected to develop what is often their first significant
independent work. For BFA students the focus of this course centers on artistic production,
conditions of conveyance and Presentation. Required at the senior level for all sculpture majors
