## Overview

This week we will review and discuss your ideation sketches and concepts for creating work that does not resemble your previous work. As you present your work, refer to your writing from the [awareness of recent creative practice](../02-recent-studio-work-analysis/02-02-awareness-of-recent-creative-practice.md) writing exercise. Sharing ideations and plans with peers is good presentation practice and offers an opportunity for others to ask questions about your assumptions and premises. Others will likely see concepts or ideas that you may have overlooked. This information can be used to make your project better.

You will have time in class to work on building your projects in preparation for critique next week.

## Learning Objectives

- Present ideations and work concepts to a group of peers
- Efficiently use studio time to independently fabricate work based on a plan
