### Begin Production

3. Spend 30 minutes documenting your activities in a report. Write down the details of:
   - What you read, articles, tutorials, videos
   - What you tried
   - What worked
   - What did not work
   - What you wanted to do
   - Images and screenshots as needed

## Be Realistic and Embrace Mistakes and Experimentation

Remember that nothing may work. It is likely that you will be able to create the example from the getting started but then it may break as you make changes and experiment. That is ok.

Document what you did and what happened. Be detailed and thorough.
