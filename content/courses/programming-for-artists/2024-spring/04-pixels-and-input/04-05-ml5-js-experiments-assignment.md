## Assignment Deliverables

1. Upload a URL to your online **ml5.js Experimental** art project via one of the following options:
   - Self published GitHub repository published to GitHub Pages
   - or
   - Link to sketch on p5.js Web Editor

## Requirements

1. Load the ml5.js library into the `<head>` of the html page.
2. Use one of the models such as handpose, facemesh, or posenet
3. Modify the provided demo examples to change the look of the hand, or face or pose
4. Combine the model with one of your previous projects.
5. Use your body for interaction rather than the keyboard or mouse
6. Experiment and have fun
7. Look at the many example on the web and be inspired by them, just make sure to create your own project and list any and all references and sourses in your code comments

### Possible Concepts

- make a graphic or image overlay over the hand, face, or pose
- have different images appear based on the position
- Use your face or hand to make images
- Experiment with p5.js `createGraphics()` to have multiple layered surfaces on the canvas

Remember that this is an experiment and you are building upon the tools of others. It is ok if the program does weird and unexpected things. Try to add new elements to the program to see what happens. Don't try to memorize everything or to work in a vacuum. Look to other's examples as listed on the ml5.js website.
