## Image Classification with Teachable Machine

![Teachable Machine Start Page](https://whatmakeart.com/courses/programming-for-artists/2024-spring/05-machine-learning-training-models/05-02-image-classification/)

[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is a project created by Google Labs that allows users to train machine learning models with nearly no code. I say nearly because while the training is just clicking buttons, some manipulation of example code is needed in order to use the newly trained model in an interesting way.
