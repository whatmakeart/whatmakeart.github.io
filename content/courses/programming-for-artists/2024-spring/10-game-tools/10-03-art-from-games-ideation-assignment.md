2. Report of production progress

## Process

### Ideation

1. Review your research and experiments from your homework. What worked well? What is too complicated to use? What could be implemented with a bit more time? WHat is visually or experientially interesting>
2. Pick tools to use. It is important to not limit yourself but it is also important to reduce the amount of available options so you have a creative framework to make.
3. Begin writing out ideas of ways that you can creatively use the "game" tools to make art.
4. What ways are the tools traditionally used? Do you want to use the tools in a predictable but new way? Do you want to create an unexpected and non-standard use of the tools?

Spend approximately 45 minutes - 1.5 hours on developing your proposal, ideation, and ideas. Add sketches, imagery, screenshots, code snippets, links to resources or anything else that might be useful to your project ides.

### Begin Production

1. After you have a concept that you want to pursue, begin production. What is the next step that you need to complete to make progress on your idea?
2. Spend 2-3 hours on producing your project
3. Spend 30 minutes documenting your activities in a report. Write down the details of:
   - What you read, articles, tutorials, videos
   - What you tried
   - What worked
   - What did not work
   - What you wanted to do
   - Images and Screenshots as needed

## Be Realistic and Embrace Mistakes and Experimentation

Remember that nothing may work. It is likely that you will be able to create the example from the getting started but then it may break as you make changes and experiment. That is ok.

Document what you did and what happened. Be detailed and thorough.

## Due

- Ideation and initial production is due next class
- "Art from Games" due in two weeks
