## Functions

There are built in functions in p5.js. `background(220);` is a built in function that draws a background on a canvas created by the built in function `createCanvas(400,400);`. Functions can help organize your program by breaking it up into smaller, understandable parts and by making code more reusable. Anytime that you notice the same code repeated in your program, there is likely a better way to write it. Perhaps it should be written as a loop, or it might be better to write it as a function. A loop is kind of like a built in function in Javascript.

### Defining Functions

```javascript
// defining a function

function myFunction() {
  console.log("Functions are rad.");
}
```

### Calling Functions

```javascript
// calling a function

myFunction();
```
