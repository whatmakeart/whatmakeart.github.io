So far we have used the [p5.js web editor](../../../../coding/p5js/p5-js-web-editor-basics.md) to write p5.js sketches. These sketches can be hosted on p5js.org and shared with others with a unique URL. But this does not allow for work without an internet connection and it does not allow you to create your own custom projects and host them on your own domain and website. In order to work on code on your computer without the browser and to facilitate publishing custom websites, it is best practice to set up a local development environment.

What is a development environment? And what is a local one?
