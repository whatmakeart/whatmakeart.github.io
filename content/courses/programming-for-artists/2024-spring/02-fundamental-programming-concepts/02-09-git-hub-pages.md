## Register Domain from GitHub Student Developer Pack

The GitHub Student Developer Pack provides multiple options for registering complimentary domain names.

- .me domain for 1 year from Namecheap.com
- .tech domain for 1 year from .tech domains
- .live domain for 1 year from Name.com

A custom domain allows you to control content on the web. A domain is just a locator like a postal address, room number, phone number, social media id, or email address. A domain alone does not have any content. A phone number is not a phone and the number does not have any content. For the phone number to have value or meaning, it must point to a specific phone and connect to it when entered on another phone. The same is true for a domain name.

To associate content with a domain name, the domain needs to point to and connect to online hosting. There are many hosting providers that range in price from free to much more expensive.

GitHub Pages offers a free and convenient way to host static web content for your programming projects and creative coding files. Your project files in your local development environment can be linked to online repositories at GitHub and serve as the basis for a website.
