## Assignment Deliverables

1. Written description of what you did and what happened.
   - Label File YYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Game Library Playground Report
2. If available, a URL of any experiments

## Process

1. Pick a web based game library and follow its getting started guide.
2. Make the example from the quickstart, or learn, or tutorial section.
3. Make changes to the example to customize it.
4. Review additional resources and guides to try to make more complex interactive and visual experiences.
5. Spend 4 hours on this activity
6. Spend 30 minutes documenting your activities in a report. Write down the details of:
   - What you read, articles, tutorials, videos
   - What you tried
   - What worked
   - What did not work
   - What you wanted to do
   - Images and Screenshots as needed

Remember that nothing may work. It is likely that you will be able to create the example from the getting started but then it may break as you make changes and experiment. That is ok.

Document what you did and what happened. Be detailed and thorough.
