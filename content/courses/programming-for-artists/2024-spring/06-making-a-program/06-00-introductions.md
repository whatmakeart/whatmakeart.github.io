## Overview

Just getting started with a programming project is the hardest part. Where does one begin? What tools and techniques should be used? What is the most efficient approach? How do you learn the things that you don't know you don't know? There seems to be endless choices.

We will review your program project ideations and break the task of making the program up into manageable chunks. Each of these can be attempted individually and then brought together as a whole.

We will also examine and experiment with AI code generation as a tool to realize our creative visions.

- How do you feel about "AI"?
- Can AI use be ethical? Why or why not?
- How can you use AI tools and still learn and have a creative voice?
