What is better than one brain? ... Two brains!!

Present your program ideations to a peer or peers. do your best to describe what you want the program to do and how you want it to flow. After you describe the program, ask your partner to tell you what the program intends to be. Note differences in their interpretation vs your vision.

Work together to spot logical holes in the program plan. Break down complex tasks into smaller pieces. Work on drawing a flow chart together to get a sense of where to start with the program.

Repeat for your partner's program ideation.
