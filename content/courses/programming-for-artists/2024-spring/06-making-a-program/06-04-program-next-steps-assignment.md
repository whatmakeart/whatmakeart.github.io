## Overview

Review the next steps for your program as discussed in class. Spend a 4.5 hours working on your program. What should you do?

- Continue to break the project into smaller pieces.
- Add more functionality in small bits.
- Write down what you did.
  - What happened?
  - Did it work?
  - What did you try next?
  - What resources did you research?
  - Did you try some demos?
  - What didn't work?
  - What will you try next?

Even if nothing works, that is ok. Write down what happened, what you tried to do and how it didn't work. Think about what you could try next and list that as your next steps.

Spend an honest 4.5 hours researching, trying, testing, experimenting, reading, and report on the results. There are no wrong answers except not spending the time to try.

Email any questions.
