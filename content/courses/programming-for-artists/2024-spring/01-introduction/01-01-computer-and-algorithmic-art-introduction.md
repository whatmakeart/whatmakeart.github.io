## Intro to Computer and Algorithmic Art

Algorithmic Art predates the invention of the computer and digital technology. The specific geometries and math used in Islamic tiling patterns such as such as [Girih tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih_tiles) are are described by Roman Verostko as pre-digital precursors to algorithmic art. [^2] Lillian Schwartz was a pioneer in using computers to create computer generated art. In the late 1960s she worked as a consultant at Bell Laboratories and developed tools and techniques for using computers in film and animation. She is also credited with creating the first digital drawing with a preasure sensitive tablet that was transmitted around the world in real-time. [^1-lillian]
