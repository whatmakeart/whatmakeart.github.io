## Overview

_Programming for Artists_ is designed to bridge the gap between traditional art and the digital world. This course is tailored for artists who are curious about incorporating technology into their creative process, and no prior programming experience is required.

### Embracing the Digital Canvas

In this course, we will dive into the realm of custom software as a medium for artistic expression. You'll learn how to use programming not just as a tool, but as an integral part of your artistic process. This journey will take you through the rich history, theory, and practical applications of software arts, offering a comprehensive understanding of how digital technology can enhance artistic expression.

### Programming: A New Language for Artists

Think of programming as learning a new language, one that allows you to communicate with computers and bring your artistic visions to life in ways you never imagined. We will start with the basics of programming and gradually progress to more complex concepts. Our hands-on approach ensures that you learn through creating, experimenting, and expressing yourself digitally.

### Exploring the Hacker's Mindset

In this class, we embrace the hacker's spirit of experimentation and exploration. You will learn how to deconstruct existing technologies and creatively repurpose them for your art. This approach will not only broaden your understanding of technology but also inspire innovative ways to integrate it into your artwork.

### Interactive Art: Engaging the Audience

We will delve into creating custom human-to-computer interfaces, allowing viewers to interact with your art in dynamic ways. You'll learn how to build interactive video projections, sound works, and even expanded gaming environments. These projects will not only challenge your creativity but also engage your audience in unique and memorable experiences.

### Realizing Your Vision

By the end of the semester, you will complete a finished project, ready for exhibition. This course is not just about learning; it's about applying what you learn to create something unique and personal. You will gain not only a deeper appreciation of programming as an art form but also practical skills to bring your digital creations to life.
