SEM 233 Programming for Artists

## Course Description

This course focuses on using custom software as a medium for making art. No prior programming knowledge is necessary. Students will learn about the history, theory, and practice of software arts, as well as the fundamentals of programming through creative exercises. In this class, we will explore the computer enthusiast's notion of hacking as an experimental approach to technology. We will examine existing technologies and find new or extended ways to apply them in creative practice. Students will receive instructions and one-on-one guidance on how to alter existing computer programs to new purposes. They will also learn how to create artworks with custom human-to-computer interfaces that allow viewers to experience and interact with. Works made in this class may include interactive video projection, interactive sound works, expanded gaming environments, video and audio synthesis, and generative drawing and painting realized as animation or digital prints.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop thought and dialog about programming as an art practice, and the related history of new media and current emerging media arts.
- Gain a working understanding of programming fundamentals and the use of micro-controllers and sensors as they relate to creating responsive art and design projects.
- Produce a finished working project, ready to show, by the end of the semester.
- Learn the fundamentals of programming through generative exercises of increasing complexity.
- Learn to synthesize and manipulate of sound.
- Produce interactive projects that combine responsive sound and animations.
- Use microcontrollers and sensors in responsive sound and image systems.
- Integrate responsive video, using both pre-recorded clips and live cameras.
- Use basic computer vision as it relates to the use of motion tracking, color tracking, face and shape recognition in the context of installation art.
