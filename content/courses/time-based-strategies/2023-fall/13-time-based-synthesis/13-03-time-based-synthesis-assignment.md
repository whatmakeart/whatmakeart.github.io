## Assignment Overview

Interwoven Realities: A Time Based Synthesis Assignment

For this project, students are challenged to create an integrated media sculpture that combines at least five of the techniques learned during the semester. This assignment is an opportunity to synthesize skills in digital media and physical sculpture, creating an artwork that reflects contemporary issues or personal narratives.

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Integrate digital technologies in fine art practices.
2. Understand the historical and theoretical backgrounds of digital and analog media arts.
3. Develop skills in software for media art production (Adobe Suite, CNC software, 3D modeling).
4. Create complex interdisciplinary projects.
5. Manage digital file workflows.
6. Employ a multidisciplinary approach in art projects.
7. Troubleshoot and self-learn electronic and digital technology.
8. Utilize multimedia elements in artistic production.
9. Illustrate and create project plans and visualizations.
10. Capture and document artworks through digital photography and videography.

### Techniques to Choose From (Minimum 5):

1. Camera use (ISO, shutter speed, aperture).
2. Video editing and abstract video creation.
3. Chroma keying and abstract visual effects in After Effects.
4. Motion and camera tracking in After Effects and Blender.
5. Basic 3D modeling and rendering in Blender.
6. Projection mapping with MadMapper and Isadora.
7. Synchronizing music with video.
8. 3D modeling for 3D printing.
9. Creating parametric models in Fusion 360 for laser cutting.
10. Kinetic sound installations using synchronous motors.

## Creative Prompts (Choose 1 or create your own):

### Echoes of Time

Create a dynamic installation that delves into the concepts of time, memory, and impermanence. Use projection mapping to display abstract video art on 3D printed structures, symbolizing fleeting memories. Integrate kinetic sound elements that respond to audience movement, creating a multisensory experience. The installation should evoke a sense of nostalgia and the transient nature of moments.

### Digital Biome

Design an interactive piece that represents a digital-natural ecosystem. Use 3D modeling to create organic forms resembling flora and fauna, and combine these with sound art to simulate a living environment. Implement projection mapping to bring these forms to life, creating an immersive experience that blurs the line between the digital and the natural world. Consider how technology can augment or disrupt natural processes.

### Urban Symphony

Develop an installation that embodies the essence of urban life, capturing its chaos and rhythm. Combine abstract video footage of cityscapes with sound art that mirrors urban sounds. Incorporate kinetic sculptures that mimic the movement of city life, and use projection mapping to create an evolving urban landscape. The piece should reflect the energy, diversity, and complexity of urban environments.

### Interactive Memory Maze

Create an immersive experience exploring the theme of memory. Use motion tracking to trigger changes in video and sound as viewers navigate through a labyrinth of 3D modeled structures. Each section of the maze should represent different aspects or types of memories, using visual and auditory stimuli to evoke emotions and recollections in the audience.

### Futuristic Relics

Imagine an artifact from the future, blending advanced technology with historical or mythical elements. Combine laser-cut designs with 3D printed components, and use video projections to tell a story about its origin and purpose. The piece should invite viewers to speculate about the future, technology, and their intersections with humanity.

### Sonic Landscape

Construct a sculptural installation that visualizes sound. Use synchronous motors to create kinetic sculptures that move in response to sound frequencies. Incorporate projection mapping to add a visual layer to the soundscape, creating an environment where sound is not only heard but also seen and felt. This piece should explore the physicality of sound and its impact on space and perception.

### Digital Reflections

Create a reflective space that explores identity in the digital age. Use mirrors and screens to project abstract videos and images that respond to viewer interactions through motion tracking. Integrate sound art that varies with the projected imagery, delving into how technology shapes our self-perception and interactions.

### Eco-Futurism

Design a piece that imagines a future where technology and ecology are harmoniously integrated. Use 3D modeling and digital fabrication to create structures that mimic organic forms, and implement projection mapping to illustrate a narrative of coexistence and symbiosis between nature and technology.

### Historical Juxtaposition

Develop an installation that juxtaposes historical events or periods with modern technology. Use 3D printed sculptures representing historical artifacts, and overlay them with modern digital imagery through projection mapping. This installation should invite viewers to contemplate the evolution of technology and its impact on history and culture.

### Sensory Overload

Create an installation that explores the concept of information overload in the digital age. Utilize a combination of video editing, chroma keying, and abstract visual effects to create a chaotic, immersive environment. Add layers of sound art that reflect the constant barrage of information, encouraging viewers to consider the effects of living in a hyper-connected world.

## Assignment Requirements:

1. Conceptual Proposal: Describe your chosen prompt, intended techniques, and conceptual approach.
2. Progress Documentation: Maintain a log of your progress, including sketches, technical challenges, and iterations.
3. Final Presentation: Present the completed sculpture with integrated media elements.
4. Reflective Essay: Discuss the integration of techniques, conceptual development, and personal learning.
