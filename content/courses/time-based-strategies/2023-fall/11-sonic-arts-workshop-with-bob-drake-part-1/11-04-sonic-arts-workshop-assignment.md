## Assignment Deliverables

Build a free-standing motor-driven sound sculpture that creates sound/noise which varies over time. Sculptures should autonomously produce sound when turned on, but may be manipulated (“played”) while running if you wish. Sounds may be loud or soft, continuous or occasional, musical or atonal… but aim for complexity or irregularity in the patterns and sounds.

## Overview

The video examples I pointed to (Anne-f Jacques, Petr Válek) purposely focus on recycled or low-cost materials and a provisional aesthetic. This is intended to give you permission to experiment and play (especially given the 1-week timeframe), but does not dictate any particular style or aesthetic. _The primary focus should be on the sound._

You are welcome to use 3D printing to produce parts of your sculpture. This could be particularly appropriate for hubs/cams/levers to modify circular motion from the motors, or for tuned resonant cavities to amplify vibrating objects. Extruded plastic may be too soft to produce much sound directly, but feel free to experiment.

**Assignment is Due 11/21, start of class.** We will be using these sculptures in our explorations of sound art installation, and as subjects for recording , so it is critical that we have your initial pieces to build on.
