## Overview

[Bob Drake](./11-02-bob-drake.md) visits class this week for part one of his Sonic Arts Workshop. He will guide students through the construction of sound sculptures that are powered by synchronous motors that are capable of generating varying sounds or noises as time progresses. Although the sculptures will be able to produce sound independently, Bob will show students possibilities for collaborative and multi sound production. This hands on workshop is accompanied by lecture, demonstrations, reference material, and in class activities.

Students will combine recent explorations in 3D modeling and digital fabrication to build upon the sound sculptures created in the workshop. Laser cutting and 3D printing can be used to create enclosures, structures, and sound devices.

## Learning Objectives

- Create a sound sculpture with a motor
- Participate in a collaborative workshop environment
- Ideate new possibilities through the combination of motors and digital fabrication
