To work with video as a creative medium requires some tools and equipment. Unless all the footage used is found footage, then a basic video capture device is needed. A non-linear video editing software program will allow you to change the video through the editing process.

In this class we will us Adobe Premiere for video editing.

Additional software tools from Adobe include:

- Adobe After Effects - animation and motion graphics
- Adobe Audition - sound editing

Make sure you have Adobe Premiere, After Effects an Audition installed on your personal computer.
