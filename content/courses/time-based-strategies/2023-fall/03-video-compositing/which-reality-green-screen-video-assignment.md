## Concepts to Consider

Once video is separated from the background with a green screen or other masking technique, then it can be manipulated in creative ways to create new interesting visual compositions. With video one is not limited to a single static composition, the element of time allows things to change.

### Scale

### Changing Place or Environment

### Subtracted or Negative Space

- Wear a green square on your shirt and suddenly there is a gap or "negative space" on your body that can be filled in with video.
- Paint green circles on your face and fill each one with a different video.

## Repeat Elements

`Control C` or `Command C` followed by `Control V` & `Command V` is the quintissential action of digital workflows. Once something is digital, making copies is nearly costless. Multiple instances of keyed out green screen footage can be placed in the same seen. Repetition is a fundamental design principle that can add unity, structure, and emphasis to a visual composition.

### Use Motion Tracking and Camera Tracking

- Green screen shots are easiest to composite when done with a static camera on a tripod, but this can create less dynamic shots than if the camera was moving. One can simply have camera movement but this will likely make the footage bounce around in the viewport. A better way is to motion track the footage so that other objects and footage composited into the scene track along with the green screen footage. This can range in complexity from a simple pan track or a swirling 3D motion track.
