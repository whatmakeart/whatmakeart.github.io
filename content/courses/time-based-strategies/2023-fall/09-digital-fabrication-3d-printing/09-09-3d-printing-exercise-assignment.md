## Assignment Deliverables

1. Exported STL File of 3D print model (.stl)
   - Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname STL File.stl
2. Rendered image of 3D model (.png, .jpg, .tiff)
   - Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Rendering of 3D Print.png
3. Physical 3D printed object

## Overview

1. Model an object in [Blender](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/blender.md) for 3D printing output. Think about objects and forms that could be used as elements in videos or performance. Having a physical representation and a fully accurate digital 3D model of the same object opens up possibilities for content creation. You could use [physics simulation](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/rigid-body-physics-quick-start-tutorial-blender.md) to have the digital model tumble through space and then motion track the real object into it. **(No extra video or peformance is due for this project. This is to stimulate potential content ideas for your 3D printed object)**

## Helpful Guides

2. Make a rendering of the object in Blender or other software. Add a background. You could use the [infinite background](<(../../../../3d-modeling/blender/blender-infinite-background.md)>>) from the demo or create your own background. Save the rendering as an image and upload it.
3. Size the 3D model to an appropriate size. Use the bounding option in the 3D Print toolbox. Export an STL file for 3D printing.
4. Use Cura to slice the 3D print and save the gcode file.
5. 3D print the object on the SEM 3D Printer or the 3D printers at the think\[box\].
