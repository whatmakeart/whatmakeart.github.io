## Overview

This week students use 3D Modeling skills to create 3D Models in Blender and export an STL to 3D print in class. Basic Rendering of 3d models in Blender allows students to present visualizations of projects before fabrication.

## Learning Objectives

- Create model for 3D Printing in Blender
- Export STL file from Blender at proper scale
- Use Cura slicing software to create gcode file for 3D Printing
- Add lights and setup camera for rendering in Blender
- Make a 3D print
