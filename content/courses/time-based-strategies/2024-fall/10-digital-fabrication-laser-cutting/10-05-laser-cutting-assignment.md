## Assignment Deliverables

1. Laser cut physical object brought to class
2. Upload rendered image of 3D Model (.jpg or .png)
   - label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Laser Cut Render Image.jpg
3. Upload DXF export of parts to be cut (.dxf)
   - label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Laser Cut Parts.dxf

## Overview

1. [Model the parts in Fusion 360](../../../../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting/3d-modeling-for-laser-cutting-fusion-360.md) paying attention to joints and how thick the material is.
2. [Lay the parts flat](../../../../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting/lay-parts-flat-for-laser-cutting-fusion-360.md)
3. [Prepare a tool path](../../../../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting/export-laser-cut-toolpaths-to-dxf-fusion-360.md) that takes into account the width or kerf of the laser
4. [Export a DXF file](../../../../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting/export-laser-cut-toolpaths-to-dxf-fusion-360.md) for cutting
5. [Prepare the DXF file](../../../../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting/prepare-dxf-file-for-laser-cutting.md) according to the instructions.
6. Cut out the parts at the think\[box\]
7. Assemble the project and bring to class
8. Export a [Render Image](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/basic-rendering-fusion-360.md) from Fusion 360 with a 16:9 or 3:4 or 1:1 aspect ratio.

## Requirements

- minimum two pieces cut on laser cutter
- use minimum 1 joint more complex than a butt joint
