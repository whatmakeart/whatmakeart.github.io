With a partner shoot a minimum of 1 of each of the following 6 [shots types](../../../../video/shot-types.md).

1. Establishing Shot
2. Long Shot
3. Full Shot
4. Medium SHot
5. Close Up
6. Extreme Close Up

Although, only 1 of each shot is required for the exercise, it is a good idea to capture multiple versions and angles of each shot.

- For each shot record for a maximum of 5-7 seconds.
- Set the Shutter Speed to double the frame rate.
- Use ISO and Aperture to adjust the exposure.
