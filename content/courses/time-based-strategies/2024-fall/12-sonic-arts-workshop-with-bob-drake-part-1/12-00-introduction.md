## Overview

[Bob Drake](./12-01-bob-drake.md) visits class this week for part one of his Sound Art Workshop. In the first meeting, students will explore the fundamentals of sound art through introductions, discussions, and hands-on activities. The session begins with a round of personal introductions and reflections on sound art, followed by discussions on its distinct forms, characteristics, and vocabularies. Activities include demonstrating sound-making objects, analyzing sound qualities, and prototyping sculptural mechanisms to automate these sounds, fostering collaboration and problem-solving skills. This hands on workshop is accompanied by lecture, demonstrations, reference material, and in class activities.

## Sound Art Workshop Overview

A two week introduction to sound art in general, with a particular focus on sounding objects, kinetic sonic sculptures, and spatialized audio installations via multi-channel fixed-media. Class sessions will be a combination of lecture/demonstration/discussion and collaborative project work (mostly the latter). There will be 2 homework assignments (collect sounding objects, finishing & recording sound sculptures) - our work in class will be critically dependent on that homework. [^drake-overview]

## Learning Objectives

Students will combine recent explorations in [3D modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md) and [digital fabrication](../../../../digital-fabrication/digital-fabrication.md) to build upon the sound sculptures created in the workshop. [Laser cutting](../10-digital-fabrication-laser-cutting/10-01-laser-cutting.md) and [3D printing](../09-digital-fabrication-3d-printing/09-01-3d-printing.md) can be used to create enclosures, structures, and sound devices.

- Create a sound sculpture with a motor
- Participate in a collaborative workshop environment
- Ideate new possibilities through the combination of motors and digital fabrication
