## Assignment Overview [^drake-recording]

First (if necessary): refine your devices/sculptures so that they can reliably sound on their own Then, make a 5 minute recording of your automated sounding objects:

- Preferably, use one of the sound recorders from equipment check-out. If thatâ€™s not possible, use your own recorder, or even cell phone, as long as you can export sound files in .wav format.
- Students with enough background in audio editing may optionally manipulate/add effects/remix their sounds. Resulting track should still have some discernible aural relation to the original sound of the sculpture.
- Once completed, upload your .wav files to our shared [gDrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CKtKk6BA6-_2mzPoevWMn1ZUeF7PvY2M) so they will be available for class activities on
