## Assignment Deliverables

1. Exported 3D Model File (.blend, .ma, mb, .skp, .f3d)
   - Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname 3D Print Model

## Overview

1. Model an object in [Blender](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/blender.md), [Maya](../../../../3d-modeling/maya/maya.md), or [Fusion 360](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/fusion-360.md) for [3D printing](./09-01-3d-printing.md) output.
2. Think about objects and forms that could be used as elements in videos or performance. Having a physical representation and a fully accurate digital 3D model of the same object opens up possibilities for content creation. You could use [physics simulation](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/rigid-body-physics-quick-start-tutorial-blender.md) to have the digital model tumble through space and then motion track the real object into it. **(No extra video or performance is due for this project. This is to stimulate potential content ideas for your 3D printed object)**
3. [Photogrammetry](../../../../3d-modeling/photogrammetry.md) can be a useful tool to get started with 3D forms rather than starting from a default cube.
4. Experiment and be creative, but keep in mind [3D Print Design Guidelines](./09-03-3d-print-design-guidelines.md). It is ok to go against these guidelines but you should have a creative and intentional reason to.
