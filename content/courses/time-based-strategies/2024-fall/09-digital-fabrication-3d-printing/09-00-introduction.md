## Overview

3D Modeling, Rendering, 3D Printing, and Laser Cutting are essential supportive skills for making time based work. Basic Rendering of 3d models in Blender allows students to present visualizations of projects before fabrication. With a laser cutter, once a design or image can be represented in a computer with vectors, then a machine can cut it out with a laser.

This week students use 3D Modeling skills to create 3D Models in Blender and export an STL to 3D print in class.

Laser cutting machines can cut wood, plastic, metal and some stone. Laser cutting has a thinner kerf, the space left by a cutting device, than a CNC machine and therefore can cut smaller parts accurately and quickly. The weakness of a laser cutter is that it only works in 2D so there is not shaping, carving, or pocket cuts such as those possible on a CNC machine. We will use Fusion 360 to model simple laser cut assemblages, cut them on the laser cutter, and then put them together.

## Learning Objectives

- Create model for 3D Printing in Blender
- Export STL file from Blender at proper scale
- Use Cura slicing software to create gcode file for 3D Printing
- Add lights and setup camera for rendering in Blender
- Make a 3D print

1. Be able to explain the basic principles of laser cutting, and identify materials usable in laser cutting
2. Recognize the strengths of laser cutting as well as its limitations
3. Demonstrate proficiency in preparing designs for laser cutting using vector-based images in Fusion 360 software.
4. Acquire hands-on experience in the operation of laser cutting machines
5. Assemble and finish simple laser-cut projects
