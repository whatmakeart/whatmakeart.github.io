## Overview

[3D Modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md), Rendering, [3D Printing](../../../../digital-fabrication/3d-printing/3d-printing.md), and [Laser Cutting](../../../../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting/laser-cutting.md) are essential supportive skills for making time based work. This week students use 3D Modeling skills to create 3D Models in [Blender](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/blender.md) and export an STL to 3D print in class. Basic Rendering of 3D models in Blender allows students to present visualizations of projects before fabrication.

## Learning Objectives

- Create model for 3D Printing in Blender
- Export STL file from Blender at proper scale
- Use Cura slicing software to create gcode file for 3D Printing
- Add lights and setup camera for rendering in Blender
- Make a 3D print
