## Overview [^drake-workshop]

Workshop begins with a check-in and a viewing of Lucy Raven’s Demolition of a Wall (Album 2) to discuss sound art’s spatial dynamics and challenges in traditional settings. In the Sculpture + Expanded Media installation room, students arrange their sound sculptures, refining placement to balance individual and collective interactions. Motion sensors and sequenced triggers are introduced to demonstrate interactivity. Students will attempt to identify each others' sound recordings by listening alone and categorize by continuity, pitch, and volume to prepare for multichannel authoring.

Bob Drake introduces multichannel audio setups, focusing on an 8-channel array and SpaceControl, a tool for spatial sound. Students use it collaboratively to combine recordings into a cohesive group project, guided by a graphic score.The session ends with the final installation, blending multichannel recordings with sound sculptures. Students refine the sonic environment and discuss the immersive qualities of sound, contrasting live and recorded experiences.
