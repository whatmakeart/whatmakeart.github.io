## Assignment Deliverables

1. Bring Sound Object, **hidden in a container**, to class with repeatable sound that you practiced.

## Assignment Overview

Collect an object or objects that you can physically manipulate to make sounds that you find interesting, and practice “playing” them.

- Focus on the sonic properties of the objects; visual aspects are not important for this exercise.
- You should be able to manipulate your sounding object(s) to produce audible variations (in tone,
  volume, timbre, etc.). Practice the techniques you’re going to use to activate them.
- Sounding your objects must be repeatable - no one-time sound events (a balloon that you pop
  won’t work for this; a balloon you use as a drum could).
- Percussive or friction-based actions (hitting/rubbing/scraping) are obvious choices for sounding
  strategies, but you are not limited to just those.
- No electronics; no objects purpose-made to make sound (musical instruments).
- Objects should be no larger than a paper grocery bag. Please bring your objects to class in a
  bag, box, or otherwise hidden from view, so that we can hear you play them before we see
  them.

Be prepared to demonstrate your sounds. [^drake-assignment]
