To make a 3D model to scale in Blender, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Blender project.
2. In the Item panel, [set the units in Blender to the desired measurement scale](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/change-units-blender.md). For example, if you want to create a model that is 1 meter in length, set the units to Meters. This is not strictly necessary since you can type in any units but it can be helpful.
3. Add a new object to the scene. You can do this by pressing Shift + A and selecting the type of object you want to create.
4. In the Item panel on the right hand side, set the dimensions of the object to the desired size. For example, if you want to create a model that is 1 meter long, 0.5 meters wide, and 0.25 meters high, set the dimensions to 1, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively.
5. You can now edit the model as desired from this rough sized scale. Continue to add more details and objects at the correct size.
6. When you are finished editing the model, you can export it to a variety of file formats, such as STL or OBJ.

Here are some additional tips for creating 3D models to scale in Blender:

- Use reference images or models to help you accurately scale your model.
- Use the Measure tool to measure the dimensions of your model as you work. To do this, press `Shift + Spacebar + M` to open the Measure tool. Then, click on two points on the object to measure its length.
- When scaling the object, make sure to keep the aspect ratio the same.
- Use the snapping feature in Blender to ensure that the object is properly aligned.
- If you are importing an object from another program, make sure that the scale is set to 1:1.
