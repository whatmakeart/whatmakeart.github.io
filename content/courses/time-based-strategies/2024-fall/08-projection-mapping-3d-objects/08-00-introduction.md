## Overview

[3D modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md) offers an efficient way to work with space and objects in a virtual environment. Created 3D environments and objects can be used in video projects, [projection mapping](../../../../video/projection-mapping-basics.md), interactive installations, VR, AR, and games.

## Learning Objectives

- Use basic 3D modeling tools to visualize a "virtual" version of a real object or space
- Export obj from a polygon mesh modeling program
- Create mock up images of ideas
