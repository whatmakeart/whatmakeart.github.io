## Assignment Deliverables

1. Upload a brief ~30 second video documentation of the projection mapping 3D modeled object installation (.mp4)
   - Label the file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Projection Mapping 3D Modeled Object Video.mp4

## Overview

Use a projector and make a mapping of selected objects and the environment. One of the objects must be fabricated by you and be imported as a 3D object.

## Process

1. Use you fabricated 3D object and / or fabricate alternative or additional 3D objects. Painting a object so it has light uniform color or using materials that are light and uniform in color will help your projection mapping pop out and be visible.
2. 3D model the object to scale in [Blender](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/blender.md) or [Maya](../../../../3d-modeling/maya/maya.md). You can use any other 3D Modeling program if you can produce an OBJ with UVs.
3. Export the object as an OBJ file with the UVs Unwrapped.
4. Import the 3D model into projection mapping software.
5. Use at least one control on a generative effect, audio input or other.
6. Add effects to quads.
7. Add original media.
8. Add a minimum of two masks.
9. Take a ~30 second video of the installation. You can shoot from different angles and edit the video together to capture more of the feeling of being present with the projection mapping installation or you can use a single steady wide shot for documentation purposes.
