## Overview

Camera tracking is a fundamental tool for manipulating video footage. Plan out a sequence of camera tracked shots with a minimum of one each of the following [shot types](../../../../video/shot-types.md):

- Camera tracked with a minimum of one additional element shot as an Establishing Shot
- Camera tracked with a minimum of one additional element shot as a Full Shot
- Camera tracked with a minimum of one additional element shot as a Medium Shot
- Camera tracked with a minimum of one additional element shot as a Close Up

The backgrounds and environments for the shots can be related visually or unrelated. Add additional video elements to each shot. Think about the angle and composition of the background and lighting before framing shot. If using a green screen in footage that is added to the motion tracked shots, key out the green screen and use Premiere Pro or After Effects to make the composite.

Edit the different shots types together and export as a single video. Sound is not required.
