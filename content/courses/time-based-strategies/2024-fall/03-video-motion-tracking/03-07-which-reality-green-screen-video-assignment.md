## Assignment Overview

Review the artists and videos on the [green screen video art](./03-01-green-screen-video-art.md) page. Watch the videos, visit the artists' websites, go down algorithmic rabbit holes on YouTube and Vimeo. Make notes about what you find interesting and why. Also, take a second look the artists and videos on the [Abstract Video](../02-video-selection-tools-and-effects/02-09-abstract-video.md) page in the previous module.

Use a combination of [chroma keying](../../../../video/chroma-key-basics.md), rotoscoping, luma keys, generative video, found footage, sounds, 3D environments and other video compositing techniques to answer the question, "Which reality?" Is this reality or is it an illusion? How do we know what is real when human perceptions are disconnected from the nature of the universe?

### Final Video Requirements

- minimum 30 seconds to a maximum of 60 seconds
- use at least one green screen shot, can use more
- use at least one motion tracking shot, can use more
- use a self generated abstract video, could be made with analog or digital means
- use sounds created by you

## Concepts to Consider

Once video is separated from the background with a green screen or other masking technique, then it can be manipulated in creative ways to create new interesting visual compositions. With video one is not limited to a single static composition, the element of time allows things to change.

### Scale

Changing the scale of the character, objects, or environment can have dramatic effects on the viewer's perception of your content. For dramatic changes in scale, such as shrinking a person down or turn a person into a giant, it is important to use the concepts of perspective. For example, when shooting a "giant" move the camera as low as possible so that the camera is looking up at the person from a "worm's eye view". This will make it more believable since if there was a giant in reality we would have to look up to see it.

### Changing Place or Environment

Removing the original context by changing the depicted place or environment can make new associations with your content. An environment can change within the same shot or on transitions. Multiple environments can be combined

### Subtracted or Negative Space

- Wear a green square on your shirt and suddenly there is a gap or "negative space" on your body that can be filled in with video.
- Paint green circles on your face and fill each one with a different video.

## Repeat Elements

`Control C` or `Command C` followed by `Control V` & `Command V` is the quintessential action of digital workflows. Once something is digital, making copies is nearly costless. Multiple instances of keyed out green screen footage can be placed in the same seen. Repetition is a fundamental design principle that can add unity, structure, and emphasis to a visual composition.

### Use Motion Tracking and Camera Tracking

Green screen shots are easiest to composite when done with a static camera on a tripod, but this can create less dynamic shots than if the camera was moving. One can simply have camera movement but this will likely make the footage bounce around in the viewport. A better way is to motion track the footage so that other objects and footage composited into the scene track along with the green screen footage. This can range in complexity from a simple pan track or a swirling 3D motion track.
