## Assignment Deliverables

1. Bring fabricated physical 3D object to next class (Small objects do not work well so try to make it at least as big as your torso if not bigger.)

## Overview

Make a physical object for projection mapping on. Relatively geometric forms work well. Make sure to have plenty of edges and specific points to be able to use projection mapping calibration tools.

We will [3D model](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md) the objects next class with [Blender](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/blender.md), [Fusion 360](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/fusion-360.md), or [Maya](../../../../3d-modeling/maya/maya.md).
If the object you model is super organic, [photogrammetry](../../../../3d-modeling/photogrammetry-software.md) may offer a better way of creating the mesh for use with projection mapping.
