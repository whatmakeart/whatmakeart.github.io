## Assignment Deliverables

- Bring fabricated physical 3D object to next class

## Overview

Make a physical 3D object that we will [3D model](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md) in class with [Blender](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/blender.md), [Fusion 360](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/fusion-360.md), or [Maya](../../../../3d-modeling/maya/maya.md). If the object you make is relatively geometric, make sure to have plenty of edges and specific points to be able to use projection mapping calibration tools.
If the object you model is super organic, [photogrammetry](../../../../3d-modeling/photogrammetry-software.md) may offer a better way of creating the mesh for use with projection mapping.
