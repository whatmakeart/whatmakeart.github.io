## Overview

Projection mapping transforms ordinary objects, surfaces, or architectural structures into dynamic, visually stunning displays by projecting light and images onto them. As you move into more advanced projects, using dedicated software allows for greater flexibility and precision, while programs like After Effects or DaVinci Resolve can still be used to create video content and animations.

This learning module explores the key elements of projection mapping, including setup, equipment, and different methods to bring your projection to life. By mastering both the technical and creative aspects, you'll gain the tools needed to effectively design visual projections.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Projection Mapping Fundamentals
- Create Projection Mapping Content
