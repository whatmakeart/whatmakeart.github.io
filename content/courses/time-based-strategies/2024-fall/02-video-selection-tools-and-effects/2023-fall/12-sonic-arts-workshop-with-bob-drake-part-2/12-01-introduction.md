## Overview

This week students will present their motorized sound sculptures and collaborate to make a sound art installation. After collaborating to make installations with the sound sculptures, [Bob Drake](../11-sonic-arts-workshop-with-bob-drake-part-1/11-02-bob-drake.md) will guide students on how to make recordings of sound installations. These recordings will be used to create a "geolocated sound walk" throughout the campus using the sound mapping software [echos](https://echoes.xyz/).

## Learning Objectives

- create a collaborative sound installation with motorized sound sculptures
- learn the basics of recording audio
- edit audio for use in a separate work
- use software to create an interactive geolocated sound walk
