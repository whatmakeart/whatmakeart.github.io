## Overview

The end of semester synthesis project is designed to challenge students to think critically and creatively about the integration of different media, encouraging the creation of artworks that are not only technically proficient but also conceptually rich and relevant to contemporary discussions in the field of time based arts.

This module encourages students to push the boundaries of traditional sculpture and digital media, creating works that resonate with contemporary artistic practices and personal narratives. It's an opportunity to showcase their technical abilities, creative vision, and conceptual depth as learned during the semester studying [Time Based Strategies](../00-getting-started/00-02-time-based-strategies-syllabus.md).
