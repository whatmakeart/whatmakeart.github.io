Planar tracking with the Mocha plugin in After Effects offers advanced tracking of flat or planar surfaces. Planar tracking uses the 2D texture of the tracked area in the footage rather that individual points used in point tracking. This helps with difficult to track surfaces.

To access the plugin in After Effects:
