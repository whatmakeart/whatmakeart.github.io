## Assignment Deliverables

1. Make a list of the steps needed to complete your project as envisioned. Add this list and any supporting documents to a reply in the course [discussion thread](https://cia.instructure.com/courses/1523/discussion_topics/4548).

## Overview

How do you make a list of steps for something you have not done before, let alone know what order to do them in? Often, even if you have not done something, you may have completed a similar task. Use past experience as a guide

Start with writing down what the project is, no matter how basic that may seem. It it impossible to get anything done with a "blank page." So, get rid of the blank page by writing something, anything. Then think about what parts the project could be broken into. Even if the only steps you have are:

1. Start project
2. Work on project
3. Finish project

You now have an outline. Now fill in the gaps. What materials or equipment do you need to start? What work does the project need? What form will the finished project be?

1. Start Project
   - Gather materials equipment
2. Work on project
   - Shoot and edit footage
3. Finish Project
   - Export H.264 mp4 file

"Gather materials and equipment" and "Shoot and edit footage" are both vague, but are so much better than a blank page. Repeat the process until you have at least 10 or so items. No need to over plan an lock in unnecessary steps, so keep it detailed but loose and editable based on what happens during the process.

You can also throw you draft list into a large language model and ask it to look for missing steps or offer suggestions about ways to complete the project. It will likely say redundant things but will also probably offer suggestions that spark your creativity into action.

2. Think about the next physical action you need to do to make progress on the list.
3. Then do it.

5. Do the next physical action.
6. Repeat and repeat.
