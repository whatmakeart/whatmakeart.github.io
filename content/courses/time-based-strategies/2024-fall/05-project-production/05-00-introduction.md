## Overview

Students begin by reviewing and assessing their ideation sketches. Objectively evaluating concepts and ideas before moving to project production can save time and resources. If a concept is not developed enough, now is the time to expand upon it. If the scope is too big for the time allotment and available resources, best to consolidate into the core idea. Catching issues earlier allows one to work more confidently and tackle the inevitable future project complications by not creating problems in the present.

After concept and ideation evaluation, a production plan is drafted. What has to happen to complete the project? Check out cameras? Make shooting list? Scout locations? Gather b-roll? Create abstract video or effects? Create a list of sounds? Editing?

At the start of a project, the options for production can become overwhelming since there is so much to do. Making a list breaks a larger project into smaller, discrete parts. All of the steps might seem impossible, but usually the first step is doable, even if the first step is as simple as creating a "Project Folder" on your computer or clearing your desk in your studio.
