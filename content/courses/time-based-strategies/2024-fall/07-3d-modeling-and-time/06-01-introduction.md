## Overview

3D Modeling offers an efficient way to work with space and objects in a virtual environment. Created 3D environments and objects can be used in video projects, projection mapping, interactive installations, VR, AR, and games.

## Learning Objectives

- Use basic 3D modeling tools to visualize a "virtual" version of a real space
- Create mock up images of ideas
