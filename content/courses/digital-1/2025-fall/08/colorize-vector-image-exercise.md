Scale your image to be smaller on the artboard in Illustrator. Make sure to sale the line work properly. Copy the image 3 time for a total of four images on the page. Use the colorize tools in illustrator to change three of the images to color harmonies of your choice. Experiment with multiple different harmonies by making additional copies of your image on the page. Select your three favorite combinations.
Write down why you chose the final colorizations that you did and why you think they are good. Add this to your project statement.
