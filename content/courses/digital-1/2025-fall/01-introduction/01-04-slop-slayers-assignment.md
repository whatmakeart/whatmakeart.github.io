## Assignment Deliverables

1. Photoshop PSD file sized 11” x 17” or 17" x 11" with 5100 pixels on the long side. Do not flatten the image, keep all of the layers in the file.
   - Label the file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Slop Slayers.psd
2. Exported JPG file of same image
   - Label the file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Slop Slayers.jpg

## Assignment Overview

Transform a raw, unrefined AI-generated slop image into a compelling, intentional, and technically proficient work of digital art.

You have been provided with three images generated by an AI using only the raw text from our in-class exercise. These images may have compositional oddities, strange lighting, nonsensical details, and a general lack of artistic focus. Choose one images and become its "slayer." Identify its weaknesses and use your creativity to correct, enhance, and ultimately slay the slop.

## Requirements

Successfully integrate a minimum of 3 different types of images into a purposeful, well-designed composition. Consider each of your different visual approaches and images to be themes in your design. Repetition of these themes, with variation, can help build structure. Transitional elements are areas of your composition that have characteristics of two or more of your materials and visual approaches. These can help integrate things that are visually different and make them belong together in the same composition.

## Process

Analyze the Slop: Begin by critically examining your chosen AI image. What works? What fails spectacularly? Identify specific problems related to composition, lighting, anatomy, texture, and overall mood.

Formulate a Plan: Before you begin editing, decide on your artistic direction. What kind of story do you want to tell? What mood are you trying to achieve? Your goal is not just to "fix" the image, but to elevate it with a clear vision.

Adding Depth: Introduce new elements, textures, or effects on separate layers to build a richer visual narrative.

## Learning Objectives:

- Develop a critical eye for analyzing digital images.
- Use non-destructive editing workflows using layers and masks.
- Gain proficiency with selection tools in Photoshop.
