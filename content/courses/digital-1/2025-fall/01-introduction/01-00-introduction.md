Copy and Paste fundamentally separates digital workflows from analog or physical workflows. Of course physical objects and analog sound recordings can be copied and duplicated but not at the near instantaneous speed and low cost of digital duplication.

Digital tools reduce the cost of copying to near zero and open up basically endless possibilities for creativity even at low pixel dimensions. Even a 416 x 640 pixel image has more than ~10<sup>961755</sup> possibilities[^babelia] which is approximately way more than the 10<sup>97</sup> elementary particles in the known universe.

> As the [Babel Image Archive](https://babelia.libraryofbabel.info/slideshow.html) states:
> "If we glance at our surroundings, it seems as though the objects before us are immediately present, but anything we see forevermore has been foretold in the library, long before this moment and indifferent to the presence of its contents."
