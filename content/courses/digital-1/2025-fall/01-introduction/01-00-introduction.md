Copy and Paste fundamentally separates digital workflows from analog or physical workflows. Of course physical objects and analog sound recordings can be copied and duplicated but not at the near instantaneous speed and low cost of digital duplication.

Digital tools reduce the cost of copying to near zero and open up basically endless possibilities for creativity even at low pixel dimensions. Even a 416 x 640 pixel image has more than ~10<sup>961755</sup> possibilities[^babelia] which is approximately way more than the 10<sup>97</sup> elementary particles in the known universe.

Does that meant that we are mere specks in the vast cosmos and anything we can create already has a representative image in the [Babel Image Archive](https://babelia.libraryofbabel.info/slideshow.html)?

Yes.

But, who cares? Remember ~10<sup>961755</sup> is way more than the 10<sup>97</sup> so even though our existance is a mere blip in the universe, there are still way more things to be created than could ever possibly be created, so in this sense the possibilities are literally and truely, endless, so get creating.
