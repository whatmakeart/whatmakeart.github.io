1. What were the 4 levels of depth that you put in your composition? Which levels work better than others? Why?
2. Does your composition have focus and clarity? Why or why not? What visual decisions did you make to make the composition have a clear focal point and visual weight?
3. Looking at your composition again, what stands out? Does the atmospheric perspective work well? Are there places it is less successful? What would you change about it if you had more time to work on it?
