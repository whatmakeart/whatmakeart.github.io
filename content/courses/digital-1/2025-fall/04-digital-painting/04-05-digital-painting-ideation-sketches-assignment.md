Spend some time drawing ideation sketches in your sketchbook. Quickly dump many ideas down onto the page. This is one of the most crucial steps of any creative process. Get your ideas out quickly and donâ€™t censor yourself. Try to come up with as many different ideas and compositions as you can. 10 different ideation sketches is a reasonable number to complete. You will turn in your ideation sketches next week. You can go back later and pick out the good ones to develop further into complete concepts. Upload clear photographs or clear scans of your ideation sketches by next class. You can use the scanner in the lab or the photo copier in the hall on the 3rd floor to scan your sketches.
