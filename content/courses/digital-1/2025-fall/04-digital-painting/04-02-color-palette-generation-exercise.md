## Overview

Images naturally have a color palette. It may be good or bad, but it is there. It is informative to study and examine color palettes in existing images created by you and created by others. Insights can be gained by abstracting colors and values from an image. This can inform future creative descisions and be used as reference for projects.

1. Select 4 images. 2 images should be created by you. 2 dimages should be from other creators. Normally we only use public domain imagery in class but this is an example of an exception to the rule. You can choose any image from culture.
2. Collect the images in a foler and label them.
3. Open the images in Photoshop.
4. In the Libraries tab, click the + icon and selct create from image.
5. Navigate to the palettes and slect a color palet for each image.
6. Expand the Canvas down with enough space to put 5 squares or color swatches at the bottom of the image.
7. Fill the squares with the colors created in the palette.
8. Save each image with its color palette as a `.png` not a jpg. JPGs throw away too much color information.
9. Upload your modified images. _Remember you can upload a `.zip` file._
