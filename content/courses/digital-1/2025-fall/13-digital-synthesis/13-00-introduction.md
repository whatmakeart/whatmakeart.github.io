## Overview

Class begins with a review of the images collected for the [Digital Reference Collection Assignment](../12-digital-mimesis/12-02-digital-reference-collection-assignment.md). Students discuss the reasoning behind their selections and evaluated different approaches to recreate the content. Then students present their initial photo recreations and identify strong points as well as how to make the photos look more like the reference images.

After the in progress critique, students work on completing their [Digital Mimesis](../14-studio-work/14-01-digital-mimesis-assignment.md) and their [Revised Interactive Web Experience](../14-studio-work/14-02-revised-interactive-web-experience-assignment.md) projects.
