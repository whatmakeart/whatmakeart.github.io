## Overview

Students use natural language programming to create basic interactive websites. These could be game based or experiential. With the GitHub Student Developer Pack, students have access to GitHub Copilot Pro that offers multiple Large Language Models for natural language programming assistance.

Using Copilot in _Agent_ mode, keeping changes, committing changes, and then pushing the changes to remote GitHub repositories reinforces source control and version control workflows.

Students also learn how to create transparent PNGs in Photoshop for use as images sprites and how to record sound effects. Images and sound can be added to websites manually or with Copilot natural language programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Use natural language prompts with GitHub Copilot to generate and refine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for basic interactive websites or games.
- Demonstrate a fundamental version control workflow by committing, and pushing code changes to a remote GitHub repository.
- Produce original assets for web projects.
- Embed custom images and audio files into websites.
