### Photography Homework Challenges

1. Use a mid size aperture keep only the middle ground objects in focus
   - Select a location with many objects lined up. Focus on the object in the middle ground. The background and the foreground objects should be out of focus
2. Capture smooth water motion. Use a long shutter speed to make is seem like the water is made of fluffy silky smooth fuzz.
   - Use a slow shutter speed such a 1/2s or lower.
3. Capture traffic on a busy street at night with tracer light beams
   - Wait till dusk, evening, or night.
4. Make the subject appear as a pure black silhouette a bright background.
   - Place an object with a distinct shape in front of a light. Point the light towards the camera, with the object blocking it. Expose for the bright light source, not the object.
5. Forced perspective and giants
   Put a small object like a toy figure, very close to your camera lens. Position a person far away in the background. Using a small aperture such as f/22. The goal is to get both the small object and the person in focus.
6. Capture only the shadows of an object on a uniform surface
   - Use a bright light to cast a distinct shadow of an object or person on a wall, ground or other uniform surface.
   - Make the shadow the primary subject of the photograph. Experimenting with how sharp or soft you can make the shadow edges by moving the light.
