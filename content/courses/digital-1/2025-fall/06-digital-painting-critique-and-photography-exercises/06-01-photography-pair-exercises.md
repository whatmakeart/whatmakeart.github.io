2. Upload `RAW` file of each of the 12 photographic exercise
   - Label each image file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname image description (`.arw`, `.cr2`, `.dng`)

## Exercise Overview

Refer to the [basic camera settings](../01-introduction/01-01-basic-camera-settings.md) to use the exposure triangle to intentionaly capture photographic images based on the challenges below,

### Photographic Challenges

#### Shutter Speed Challenges

1. Use high shutter speed to capture liquid frozen in the air.
   - Use a shuster spped of 1/1000s or faster. It will require a lot of light so shoot outdoors, near a window, or with a strong lamp. Focus on where water will be and then lock the focus.
   - An alternative can be falling keys or other loose falling object
2. Use a long exposure, shutter speed, to capture a dark room with light traces from a cell phone flashlight.
   - Consider trying to paint with light or write your name. Use the lowest ISO, Smallest Aperature, and a 5 - 10 second exposure.
3. Capture the motion blur of a spinning object.
   - Set the F-stop to a smallish aperture, use auto ISO or a lower ISO. Set the shutter speed to 3-4 seconds.
   - The camera needs to be on a tripon or resting on a surface. Lock the focus on where the object will be, start spinning the object, then click the shutter button.
4. Pannning action shot with slower shutter speed so subject is focused but background has motion blur
   - Try a shutter speed of 1/30s or 1/60 of a second
   - Capture the subject relatively sharp while the background is blurred into horizontal streaks, giving a sense of speed.

#### Aperture Challenges

5. Use a large or wide aperture to take a portrait with the person in sharp focus but the background is completely blurry.
   - Use the lowest f-stop on the camera and get close to the subject with the background as far away as possible.
6. Take a shot with objects in foreground, middle ground, and background with everything in focus
   - use a large f-stop or small opening. You will need a lot of light.

#### Advanced Challenges

7. Use a mid size aperature keep only the middle ground objects in focus
   - Select a location with many objects lined up. Focus on the object in the middle ground. The background and the foreground objects should be out of focus
8. Capture smooth water motion. Use a long shutter speed to make is seem like the water is made of fluffy silky smooth fuzz.
   - Use a slow shutter speed such a 1/2s or lower.
9. Capture traffic on a busy street at night with tracer light beams
   - Wait till dusk, evening, or night.
10. Make the subject appear as a pure black silhouette a bright background.
    - Place an object with a distinct shape in front of a light. Point the light towards the camera, with the object blocking it. Expose for the bright light source, not the object.
11. Forced perspective and giants
    Put asmall object like a toy figure, very close to your camera lens. Position a person far away in the background. Using a small aperture such as f/22. The goal is to get both the small object and the person in focus.
12. Capture only the shadows of an object on a uniform surface
    - Use a bright light to cast a distinct shadow of an object or person on a wall, ground or other uniform surface.
    - Make the shadow the primary subject of the photograph. Experimenting with how sharp or soft you can make the shadow edges by moving the light.
