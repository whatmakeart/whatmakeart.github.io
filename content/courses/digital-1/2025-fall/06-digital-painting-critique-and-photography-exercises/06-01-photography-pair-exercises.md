## Exercise Overview

Refer to the [basic camera settings](../01-introduction/01-01-basic-camera-settings.md) to use the exposure triangle to intentionally capture photographic images based on the challenges below,

### Photographic Challenges

#### Shutter Speed Challenges

1. Use high shutter speed to capture liquid frozen in the air.
   - Use a shutter speed of 1/1000s or faster. It will require a lot of light so shoot outdoors, near a window, or with a strong lamp. Focus on where water will be and then lock the focus.
   - An alternative can be falling keys or other loose falling object
2. Use a long exposure, shutter speed, to capture a dark room with light traces from a cell phone flashlight.
   - Consider trying to paint with light or write your name. Use the lowest ISO, Smallest Aperture, and a 5 - 10 second exposure.
3. Capture the motion blur of a spinning object.
   - Set the F-stop to a smallish aperture, use auto ISO or a lower ISO. Set the shutter speed to 3-4 seconds.
   - The camera needs to be on a tripod or resting on a surface. Lock the focus on where the object will be, start spinning the object, then click the shutter button.
4. Panning action shot with slower shutter speed so subject is focused but background has motion blur
   - Try a shutter speed of 1/30s or 1/60 of a second
   - Capture the subject relatively sharp while the background is blurred into horizontal streaks, giving a sense of speed.

#### Aperture Challenges

5. Use a large or wide aperture to take a portrait with the person in sharp focus but the background is completely blurry.
   - Use the lowest f-stop on the camera and get close to the subject with the background as far away as possible.
6. Take a shot with objects in foreground, middle ground, and background with everything in focus
   - use a large f-stop or small opening. You will need a lot of light.
