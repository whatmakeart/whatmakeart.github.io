## Exercise Overview

Refer to the [basic camera settings](../01-introduction/01-01-basic-camera-settings.md) to use the exposure triangle to intentionaly capture photographic images based on the challenges below,

### Photographic Challenges

#### Shutter Speed Challenges

1. Use high shutter speed to capture liquid frozen in the air.
   - Use a shuster spped of 1/1000s or faster. It will require a lot of light so shoot outdoors, near a window, or with a strong lamp. Focus on where water will be and then lock the focus.
2. Use a long exposure, shutter speed, to capture a dark room with light traces from a cell phone flashlight.
   - Consider trying to paint with light or write yoru name.
3. Capture the motion blur of a spinning object.
4. Pannning action shot with slower shutter speed so subject is focused but background has motion blur
   - Try a shutter speed of 1/30s or 1/60 of a second

#### Aperture Challenges

1. Use a large or wide aperture to take a portrait with the person in sharp focus but the background is completely blurry.
   - Use the lowest f-stop on the camera and get close to the subject with the background as far away as possible.
2. Take a shot with objects in foreground, middle ground, and background with everything in focus
   - use a large f-stop or small opening. You will need a lot of light.

#### Advanced Chalenges
