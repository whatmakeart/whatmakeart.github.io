## Assignment Deliverables

1. Ideation sketches of minimum 5 thumbnails and 2 revised sketches `png` or `jpg` or `pdf`
   - Label files YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Atmospheric Perspective Ideation Sketches 01
2. Minimum of 5 collected original image sources `png` or `jpg`
   - Label files YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname (image description)

## Assignment Overview

### Ideation Sketches

Review what are [ideation sketches](02-05-ideation-sketches.md).

Refer to the [Atmospheric Perspective Assignment](./02-06-atmospheric-perspective-assignment.md) for what to make ideation sketches of. For this project you need to make 5 different compositional ideation sketches. Then you need to redraw 2 of the original compositions a second time. This will make a minimum of 7 unique compositional sketches.

#### Submitting Your Sketches

1.  Scan or photograph your ideation sketches.
    - Make sure the scans or photos are clear, well-lit and legible.
2.  You can submit a series of `jpg`s of your sketches or you can compile your sketches into a single `pdf` document.

### Original Content Collection

1. Take and use several (at least 5) individual, current photos as the basis for this project. Take photos of people and separate photos of places.
2. Use a good camera. Mirrorless cameras are at the equipment checkout. A cell phone can work if you are taking images with good lighting but you will be limited to a single, small aperture and a small camera sensor size.
3. Take more photos than you think you will use.
4. Take photos that relate to your ideation sketches. You can also base your ideation sketches on some of your photos. You should work back and forth fluidly from image collection to sketching and back.
5. The goal is to create new creative content, not reuse old content. Create new photographs.

#### Collect Public Domain Content of Images Not in Cleveland

The number one rule of being an artist is to make new original work. That mean always using your own original content such as photos and videos that you made.

Artists also routinely take inspiration or are influenced by another creator’s work. Artists also [appropriate](../../../../art-faq/appropriation.md) images from other sources. While it is legal and ethical to make parody work, satire work or to appropriate other artists’ work into your own under the concept of [fair use](../../../../copyright/fair-use.md) for this assignment, you may only use your own images or images explicitly in the [public domain](../../../../copyright/public-domain.md).

For the purposes of this class the only reason for using images that are not your own is that the images are important to your concept and they cannot be created by you now in Cleveland. If you want a mountain in your project, then you will likely need to use an image from the public domain. However, if you want car in your image, even though you may not find the specific car you want in Cleveland, there are plenty of cars so take your own images.

If you need to use public domain images they should be modified significantly and incorporated into an original and unique composition.

##### Examples of Reasonable Subject Matter to Use Public Domain Images include:

- Mountains
- Snow (at least not now)
- Deserts
- A weird animal
- Volcanos
