## Assignment Deliverables

1. Upload a vector image made from photographic reference
   - Label the file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname vector image (`.ai`)
2. Upload photographic reference(s) used
   - Label the file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname photo reference (`.jpg`, `.png`, `psd`)

## Assignment Overview

This project reinforces the photography and camera skills, color harmony and vector drawing.

### Process

1. Create an .ai document sized: 8.5” x 11”
2. Import your photograph into Illustrator and place it on your Artboard. You can resize your image in Photoshop to be 8.5” wide. You do not need to resample the image.
3. Make the photo layer a template layer. This locks the layer and makes it 50% translucent.
4. Use the rectangle tool and eye dropper to select 4 skin tones from your photograph.
5. Using the blob brush, not the brush tool, draw in fills on new layers. Keep the fills on different layers. Remember to label your layers and lock them when not in use so you do not disturb previous work.
6. Draw from dark to light by putting the lighter layers below the darker ones.
7. After your base colors are set, then make a second highlight layer above the four-color layers.
8. Continue to add layers and colors to fill in the rest of the image. Pay attention to which layer you are working on and which tool you have selected. It is a good idea to lock layers when not in use to prevent mistakes.
9. Make a larger brush as needed to paint in hair with the blob brush.
10. Continue working until you are satisfied with your vector image.
11. After using only color you may add lines and outlines. Create a new layer on top for your line work.
12. Create a new calligraphic brush with pressure sensitivity enabled and a variation.
13. Using the calligraphic, pressure sensitive brush your created and a drawing tablet, trace over the photograph template layer with a stylized line drawing.
14. Use the direct selection tool to adjust your lines. Remember at this stage you are using the brush tool that draws individual vector paths / lines. Hide the vector shape layers.

### Questions to Evaluate Your Work

1. Do the line and the color shapes work well together? Do they compliment each other?
2. If there is hair in the image, does it look like a 3D form or is it flat? What could be done to improve it?
3. Is there any “banding” of the color gradients? (This is like what happens on highly compressed dark skies in video.) How could this be fixed?
4. What do you think of the overall composition of the image? Is the subject engaging? Does it look intentional?
