What did your peers say? What did they write down? What do you remember?

Do you agree or dissagree? Why?

Review the ideation critique feedback from the members of your group. Then write a list or plan of action of what you will do to complete your Digital Painting Color Harmony Project. You can add additional sketches and handwritten notes to your reply. Be sure to include any questions about how to do anything in Photoshop or other questions.

Be specific and descriptive.
