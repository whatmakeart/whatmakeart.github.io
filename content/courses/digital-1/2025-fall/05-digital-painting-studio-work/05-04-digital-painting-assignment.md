## Assignment Overview

### Pick a Color Scheme:

Use Photoshop to create a unified, well-considered composition with clear, consistent use of a specific color scheme/color harmony, examples of which include:

- Complementary
- Analogous
- Triadic
- Split- Complementary
- Double Complementary

Use only the colors in your selected harmony, with variation in value and intensity.

### Digital Painting:

1. Create a PSD document sized: 11” x 14” (or 14” x 11”) at 300 ppi.
2. Label your file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Digital Painting Project.psd
3. Use any style or method of creation. If you use found images they should be modified significantly and incorporated into an original and unique composition. Digital painting is the main method of creation for this project. While using your own photos as source materials is both welcome and encouraged, the way you produce the imagery in the PSD document should be through digital painting.
4. A Wacom tablet can be very useful for digital painting. Tablets are available for checkout from the equipment checkout on the 3rd floor. [Link to CIA Checkout](https://cia.webcheckout.net/sso/patron#!/)
