1. What do you see / hear / feel?
2. What do you think about it?
3. Why do you think that?

Take notesand make sketches about what is said and discussed.

### Discussion Prompts

You are not limited to these prompts but they can help guide the discussion.

- What ideation sketches catch your eye? Why? Is it the subject matter? The composition?
- What color scheme are they using? Why did they choose this?
- How will the design be affected by the color scheme?
- What is your favorite ideation sketch? Why?
- What would you do to improve the student's ideation sketch under discussion if you were assigned to redraw them? How would that make it better?
