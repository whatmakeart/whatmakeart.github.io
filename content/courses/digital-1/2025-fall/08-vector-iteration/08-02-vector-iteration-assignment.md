## Exercise Deliverables

1. Illustrator document with a minimum of 20 different design iterations with 10 each from each design base aligned in a grid
   - YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Vector Design Iterations (`.ai`)
2. Written Project Statement describing iterative process and assessment of outcomes
   - YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Vector Color Statement (`.docx`, `.pdf`)

## Exercise Overview

Practice rapid visual iteration from two distinct starting designs. with at least one must using text. Create two completely different base designs refered to as A and B.

- Design A must incorporate text. It could be only type or a combination of text and shapes.
- Design B may not use any text. It can only use shapes that can be representative or abstract or a combination.
- Produce a minimum of 10 unique iterations from each base design.
- Each iteration must change at least two variables such as _form, proportion, hierarchy, color, type, scale, rhythm, negative space, effects_.

### Tools

- Vector shapes
- Pen Tool
- Shape Builder
- Pathfinder
- Fill / Strokes
- Recolor Artwork
- Gradients
- Blends
- Effects
- Type
- Symbols
- Pattern Tools
- Generative Recolor
- Generative Vector Prompting

### Process

1. Build Design A with text in the top left.
2. Create Design B that is completely distinct from A that does not include text in the top right.
3. For each base design Alt/Option-drag to duplicate it. Use the auto align and snapping tools to create a grid as you iterate.
4. In each iteration change a minimum of 2 variables or thiings in the design.
5. Assess the changes, then duplicate it again. If a certain iteration branch heits a dead end go back and duplicate more successful iteration version.
6. Select the best candidates, duplicate again.
7. Repeat until you have at least 10+ iterations per base design.
8. Arrange in two grids.
9. Select your top 3 from each set and copy to a new artboard.
10. Arrange the slected designs in a pleasing grid composition.

### Personal Assessment ~250â€“350 words

- What criteria guided decisions for A versus B?
- Which three A iterations are strongest and why?
- Which three B iterations are strongest and why?
- Compare each of the iteration trajectories. What did each initial design seed teach you during the iteration process? What would you try next?
