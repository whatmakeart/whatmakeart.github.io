## Exercise Deliverables

1. Illustrator document with a minimum of four color palette variations
   - YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Vector Color Palette Variations (`.ai`)
2. Written Exercise Statement describing and evaluating your choices
   - YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Vector Color Statement (`.docx`, `.pdf`)

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise you will scale your artwork, using clipping masks and proportional scaling. Then duplicate the scaled down artwork to use as the basis of set of iterations to explore, simplify, and refine color harmonies with Illustratorâ€™s Recolor tools and optional generative color prompts. You will evaluate the outcomes, select the three strongest variations, and articulate a brief rationale for each to include in your exercise statement.

### Process

1. If you have multiple layers, use a clipping mask to group all objects into a single selectable item.
2. Scale your image to be smaller on the artboard in Illustrator. Make sure that all of the paths, strokes and line work scales properly.
3. Copy the image 3 times for a minimum of four images on the page.
4. Use the recolor tools in Illustrator to change three of the images to new color harmonies of your choice.
5. Experiment with multiple different harmonies by making additional copies of your image on the page.
6. The recolor tool can simplify the ammount of colors in the image, which can be helpful for showing the color harmony.
7. Use the generative prompting to create new color schemes and harmonies.
8. Select your three favorite combinations.
9. Write down why you chose the final colorizations that you did and why you think they are good.
10. Add this to your exercise statement.
