Portrait Project Peer Evaluations

## Instructions

Read the artist statement while looking at the portrait. Get a feeling for the image and a feeling for the statement. Remember to describe what you see visually. Then write what you think about it. Finally, write your reasons for thinking that. Beyond evaluating the conceptual content have the portrait examine its visual composition and characteristics. Be specific.

You will have approximately 10 minutes to evaluate each portrait and statement.
