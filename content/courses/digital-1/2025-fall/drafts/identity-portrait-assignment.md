Using skills and techniques learned in the first two projects, present a new composition with conceptual content in addition to technical achievement. The project focuses on photographic content created by you by adjusting the camera aperture, shutter speed and ISO. Digital painting and other image making techniques may be added to convey the precise feeling and concept you want to convey to your audience.

Today’s self portrait might be different that tomorrow’s depending on their mood, shift the time if you want, doesn’t have to be today, could be past present and future selves

### Step 1 – My Identity? Your Identity? According to Who?

Who are you? How do you see yourself? How do others see you? How do you think others see you? Do you show your true self or do you keep parts of your identity under wraps?
Identity is a complex concept made up of various components both internal and external. Portraying this multifaceted combination of what makes you – you is a challenging visual task.
In addition to making a visual composition, you will also write a 250 word artist statement explaining your concept and what you intend for the viewer to understand by viewing your piece. This is not a “What you did” it is a “Why and how you did” description.

### Step 2 – Make a List / Outline

Start writing down things about you. You can start with easy superficial things like you favorite food or movie. Move on to more complex things such as your hobbies or activities you like to do. Continue probing by listing your origin, background, gender, political philosophies, interests,  
Look at this list of traits and characteristics. Circle ones that ring true as part of the core of your identity, your true self. Are there characteristics that don’t fit? Why not? Are there parts of your identity that you feel that are not represented on the list? What are they?

### Step 3 – Ideation Sketches:

Dump many ideas down onto the page. Get your ideas out quickly and don’t censor yourself. You need to sketch 8 unique compositions. Each of these sketch compositions should be a way of portraying yourself and have conceptual content.
Select 3 of these initial sketches and develop them further. Redraw these three sketches a second time. Seek ways to convey your message in more visually compelling ways.

Do not limit your ideas to traditional or conventional ideas of portraiture. A portrait does not have to be a literal representation of the subject. It does not need to show the subject at all. It does not even need to be representational; it could be abstract or somewhere in between. It does have to be well intentioned and thought out.
Every color, object, shape, compositional decision needs to be intentional. Nothing should be in the image just because you found it that way.

### Step 4 –Take Photographs with DSLR

Using your own camera or a camera from CIA checkout, take photographs to use in your project. In addition to focusing on the content of the photographs, begin to experiment with the features of a camera.

Cameras are very similar to our eyes and have many of the same functions. The aperture of a camera or “hole” is the same as our pupil in our eyes. This controls how much light reaches our eyes or the digital sensor. It also controls the depth of field, meaning how much of the image is in focus. We can change the sensitivity of the camera to light by changing the ISO. A low ISO is not sensitive and a high ISO is sensitive. We can also change the shutter speed or how long the camera is exposed to light. A slow shutter speed will let in more light but might make a blurry image if opened too long. A short shutter speed will make a sharp frozen image but may not let enough light into the camera if it is dark.
By manipulating and combining different variations of these 3 main camera settings you can get different creative results with your photography.  
Since the content of this project is up to you there is no required number of photos that you need to take. You need to take “enough” to create your image. I recommend taking more photos in different ways than you think you will need.

### Step 4 – Composing in Photoshop:

Create a PSD document sized: 11” x 14” (or 14” x 11”) at 360 dpi.
Label your file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Identity Portrait Project.psd
Use any style or method of creation as long as the main content is photo based and taken by you.
If you are incorporating digital painting into your portrait, a Wacom tablet can be very useful. Tablets are available for checkout from the equipment checkout on the 3rd floor. Checkout items are first come, first serve so make your reservations early.

Step 5 – Turn in Assignment
Photoshop Document

1. Save your PSD document with all the layers intact. Do not flatten the image.
2. Label your file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Identity Self Portrait Project.psd
   Images from Public Domain
3. If you used any images that you did not originally create, make a folder labeled YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Public Domain Images
4. Put all of the images that are not yours into this folder
5. Put a PDF in the folder that lists the sources of any images that are not yours. Label this PDF YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Public Domain Image Sources.pdf
   Artist Statement
6. Write a 250-word artist statement about the meaning and concept(s) in your portrait.
7. Why did you use certain symbols? What metaphors are you using? What stylistic choices did you make and how do they relate to presenting your identity?
8. This should not be a description of the process of making the piece. IT should be a description / statement of the meaning and conceptual content that you hope to convey to the viewer.
9. Save your 250-word artist statement as a pdf. Make sure to put your name inside the document as well as in the file name.
10. Label the PDF YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Identity Portrait Project Artist Statement.pdf
    Bundle Everything in a Folder
    • Put all three of the above items, PSD, Public Domain Image folder, Artist Statement PDF, into a folder.
    • Label the folder YYYYMMDD Identity Portrait Project
    • Upload the folder to the project Google Drive Folder
