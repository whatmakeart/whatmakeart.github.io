## Assignment Overview

Select a well-known cultural artifact, such as a movie poster, book cover, album cover, commercial advertisement, video game still, or film screenshot, and recreate it as precisely as possible using _your own original content_. This project develops your proficiency across photography, digital painting, vector illustration, compositing, and digital synthesis though the study of visual systems, style conventions, and cultural design languages.

Your goal is to get as close as possible to the “look” of the original through techniques such as composition matching, color grading, typography style, lighting and shadows, layout and proportion, texture and surface quality, and atmosphere and mood.

The assignment is not parody, it is a style study, challenging you to create rigorous reconstruction using totally original materials. Although not inherently a parody, satire and parody can help elevate the project and make it a greater creative work. While you are referencing an image for composition, style, color, and structure, you may not use any copyrighted assets from the original. All imagery, typography, illustrations, and graphics must be created by you.

### Requirements

Your final reconstruction must include:

1. At least one original photo

- You must shoot at least one photograph that recreates an element from the reference image (characters, props, environment, textures, lighting, etc.).
- You may use models, self-portraits, objects, still-lifes, or constructed scenes.

### **2. Digital Painting (at least one painted asset)**

- Use Photoshop, Procreate, or another painting tool to replicate textures, lighting effects, fabric, atmosphere, or illustrative details present in the reference.

### **3. Vector Illustration (at least one vector asset)**

- Create custom typography, logos, icons, or shapes in Adobe Illustrator.
- These should evoke the _style_ of the original but be entirely new designs.

### **4. Additional Digital Tool (choose at least one)**

Examples:

- 3D modeling (Blender, Cinema4D, Maya)
- Motion graphics or compositing (After Effects)
- Raster collage tools
- Pixel sorting / glitch art techniques
- Procedural textures
- Laser-cut or scanned physical textures integrated digitally

## **Steps & Workflow**

### **1. Choose Your Reference**

Select one approved source:

- Movie poster
- Film screenshot
- Video game still
- Album cover
- Book cover
- Advertisement
- Magazine cover

Submit your reference for approval to ensure feasibility and avoid overly simple images.

### **2. Deconstruct the Visual**

Create a breakdown sheet:

- Composition grid
- Lighting analysis
- Type hierarchy
- Color palette extraction
- Required assets list
- Techniques needed (photo, paint, vector, 3D, etc.)

### **3. Produce Your Assets**

All assets must be made by you:

- Shoot photographs that replicate poses, props, lighting, and perspective.
- Paint details that can’t be photographed.
- Build custom vector logos or type systems that mimic the genre.
- Build or source additional digital components.

### **4. Composite + Edit**

Using Photoshop (or equivalent):

- Composite all elements into a unified layout.
- Color grade to match the reference.
- Apply polish: shadows, highlights, atmospheric depth, edge blending, texture consistency.

### **5. Present**

Submit:

1. **Final reconstruction (full resolution)**
2. **Original reference image**
3. **Process documentation** including:

   - Photographs taken
   - Screenshots of Photoshop layers
   - Illustrator artboards
   - Paint layers or brushwork examples
   - Any other tools used

4. **Reflection (250–400 words)** describing decisions, challenges, creative deviations, and technical problem-solving.

## **Assessment Criteria**

| Category                               | Points | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Craft & Technical Skill**            | 30     | High-quality photography, clean vector work, convincing digital painting, and seamless compositing. |
| **Fidelity to Style/Structure**        | 25     | Strong match to the reference in mood, composition, typography, and visual language.                |
| **Originality & Asset Creation**       | 20     | All content is self-generated; logos and type are stylistically but not literally replicated.       |
| **Complexity & Ambition**              | 15     | Evidence of challenging choices, multi-tool integration, and sophisticated problem-solving.         |
| **Process Documentation & Reflection** | 10     | Clear, thorough, and professional presentation of workflow.                                         |

## **Optional Extensions**

For extra challenge:

- Recreate a fully animated version (motion graphics trailer or animated poster).
- Produce a second variant in an alternate style (e.g., Art Deco, cyberpunk, medieval manuscript).
- Generate one element physically (sculpture, print, textile) and digitize it into the composite.

If you want, I can also prepare:

- A grading rubric
- A student handout PDF
- A slide deck for class introduction
- Example assignments or sample student work scenarios

Just let me know!
