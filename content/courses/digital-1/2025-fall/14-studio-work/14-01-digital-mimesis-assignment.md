## Assignment Overview

Select a well-known cultural artifact, such as a movie poster, book cover, album cover, commercial advertisement, video game still, or film screenshot, and recreate it as precisely as possible using _your own original content_. This project develops your proficiency across photography, digital painting, vector illustration, compositing, and digital synthesis though the study of visual systems, style conventions, and cultural design languages.

Your goal is to get as close as possible to the “look” of the original through techniques such as composition matching, color grading, typography style, lighting and shadows, layout and proportion, texture and surface quality, and atmosphere and mood.

The assignment is not parody, it is a style study, challenging you to create rigorous reconstruction using totally original materials. Although not inherently a parody, satire and parody can help elevate the project and make it a greater creative work. While you are referencing an image for composition, style, color, and structure, you may not use any copyrighted assets from the original. All imagery, typography, illustrations, and graphics must be created by you.
