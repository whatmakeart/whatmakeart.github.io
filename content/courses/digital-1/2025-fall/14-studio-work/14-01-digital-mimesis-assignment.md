## Assignment Overview

Select a well-known cultural artifact, such as a movie poster, book cover, album cover, commercial advertisement, video game still, or film screenshot, and recreate it as precisely as possible using _your own original content_. This project develops your proficiency across photography, digital painting, vector illustration, compositing, and digital synthesis though the study of visual systems, style conventions, and cultural design languages.

Your goal is to get as close as possible to the “look” of the original through techniques such as composition matching, color grading, typography style, lighting and shadows, layout and proportion, texture and surface quality, and atmosphere and mood.

The assignment is not parody, it is a style study, challenging you to create rigorous reconstruction using totally original materials. Although not inherently a parody, satire and parody can help elevate the project and make it a greater creative work. While you are referencing an image for composition, style, color, and structure, you may not use any copyrighted assets from the original. All imagery, typography, illustrations, and graphics must be created by you.

### Process

1. Select one of your collected sources such as a movie poster, video game still, album cover, book cover, advertisement, or other appropriate media from the world.
2. Analyze the composition grid, lighting setup, typefaces, color palette, and visual hierarchy. Take notes so you can recall your observations.
3. Make a list of needed assets such as:
   - Photo of alligator in rain coat
   - Vector graphic of custom title treatment
   - Painted texture for background
   - Landscape photos for setting
4. Conduct your photo shoot, focusing on replicating the original's lighting and perspective.
5. Create your vector logos and type selections in Illustrator.
6. Create any necessary painted elements or textures in Photoshop.
7. In Photoshop, assemble all your original assets into the final layout.
8. Color grade all elements to unify them, add shadows and highlights, blend edges, and apply final polishing effects to match the reference.
9. Export a PNG from Photoshop.
10. Label file and upload.
