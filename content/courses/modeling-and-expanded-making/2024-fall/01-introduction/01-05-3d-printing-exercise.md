## Option 1: Clean Up Generated Mesh for 3D Printing

1. Select an interesting mesh and open it in a 3D modeling program.
2. Edit and modify the mesh with sculpting and other 3D modeling tools.
3. Save the edited version as an STL if using a mesh modeling program, or as a STEP if using a parametric solid modeling program.

## Option 2: Create New Mesh for 3D Printing

Some images convert to relatively good 3D meshes. Other images produce an unusable mess. If none of your generated 3D meshes are able to be cleaned up you can create a new 3D mesh with the modeling program of your choice.

1. Keep the spirit of simple 3D forms as generated from the AI programs.
2. You can even use the same reference images.
3. Save the edited version as an STL if using a mesh modeling program, or as a STEP if using a parametric solid modeling program.

## Slice Meshes and 3D Print with Bambu Studio

Using Bambu Studio, students will slice their 3D objects and combine them into printable 3mf project files.
