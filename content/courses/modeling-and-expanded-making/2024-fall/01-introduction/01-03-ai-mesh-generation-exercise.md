AI mesh generation uses trained models to generate a 3D mesh from a 2D source image or a text prompt. This technology does not currently produce high quality meshes but it is important to be aware of ongoing developments in the field in order to take advantage of them in your artistic practice.

## In Class Exercise

1. Use images and photos of objects and the mesh generation tools above to create 3D .obj meshes and videos.
2. Try images made with AI image generators for different results.
3. Save and label your mesh and video files.
