## Overview

This course introduces students to a wide range of 3D content creation processes including, 3D modeling, photogrammetry, lidar scanning, AI mesh creation, mesh modeling, parametric solid modeling, rendering, animation, 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC machining, photo matching, and prototyping.

Beginning with a brief survey of various 3D modeling programs students then make a small 3D model to 3D print in class. Students explore how to use 3D modeling for ideation and rendering mock up proposal images for artwork.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify 3D modeling software for parametric, mesh, and sculpting
- Create a scale digital 3D model of a physical object
