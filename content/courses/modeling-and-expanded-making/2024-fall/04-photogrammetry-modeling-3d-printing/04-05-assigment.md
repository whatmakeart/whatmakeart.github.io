## Assignment Deliverables

1. 3D modeling file of imported photogrammetry scan and created sculpture (.blend, .mb, .ma)
   - Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Photogrammetry with 3D Sculpure
2. 3D Print of the sculpture
3. Object from photogrammetry

## Overview

1. Select an object, interior architectural feature, outdoor architectural feature, building, or natural object.
2. Use photogrammetry to 3D capture the geometry and form.
3. Use a measuring device to scale the object in 3D modeling software.
4. Design and 3D model a sculptural form in response to the 3D scan. It should relate to the structure and attach or interact with it.
5. 3D print the sculpture at scale to fit with the scanned object in physical space.
