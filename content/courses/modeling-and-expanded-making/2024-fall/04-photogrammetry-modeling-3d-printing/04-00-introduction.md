## Overview

Students explore how to merge technology and creativity by using photogrammetry and 3D photo perspective matching to create accurate dimensional models of interior and exterior architectural spaces. A few calibration measurements will be taken on-site to ensure scale accuracy, but most of the model creation will rely on recorded images.

Focus shifts to designing and creating site-specific sculptural concepts that fit within the modeled environment. Digital sculptures will be brought into the physical world with [3D printing](../../../../digital-fabrication/3d-printing/3d-printing.md). For smaller, interior locations, prints will be scaled to fit its intended site, as long as the print can fit within the printerâ€™s bed size limitations. For large, exterior sites, first print a scaled-down model of the building, with the sculpture printed in a contrasting filament color, creating a clear visual distinction between the two elements.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply photogrammetry techniques to record accurate 3D data of interior spaces and exterior buildings
- Use 3D modeling software to generate detailed, dimensionally accurate models of architectural spaces based on photographic data
- Calibrate and scale the 3D models correctly for use in sculptural planning from a few on-site measurements
- Design Sculptural Concepts for Specific Sites: Develop creative sculptural ideas that respond to and enhance the specific characteristics of a modeled interior or exterior space
- Create and refine digital 3D models of site-specific sculptures using modeling software, ensuring that the scale and proportions fit the context of the chosen site
- 3D print scaled-down architectural models and site-specific sculptures
- Analyze how scale and material choices impact the interaction between sculpture and architectural space in both digital and physical forms
- Reflect on how sculptural elements can transform or enhance an architectural space
