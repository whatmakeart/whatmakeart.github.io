Individual frames can be extracted from a video. Extracting individual frames from a video can be useful for exporting a video with an alpha channel, converting frames for compositing with 3D rendered content, or for exporting frames for use in photogrammetry.

The ubiquitous video tool [ffmpeg](../../../../video/ffmpeg.md) allows precise extraction of frames from the command line and has many options such as specifically starting the extraction on keyframes in compressed H.264 video. Although ffmpeg is a powerful tool, it is a bit clucking to use without a graphical user interface.

The open source video software, VLC, can extract frames from a video with a graphical user interface, but the options are buried in the advanced settings.

Adobe Premiere can export media as an image sequence.
