## Overview

3D Printing and Laser Cutting have different advantages and disadvantages as digital fabrication processes. 3D printing can print most 3D forms but can be slow, require the use of supports, and have size limitations. Laser cutting is fast but has material thickness limitations, specific material restrictions, and can only cut planar surfaces. Combining both techniques can leverage their respective strengths.
