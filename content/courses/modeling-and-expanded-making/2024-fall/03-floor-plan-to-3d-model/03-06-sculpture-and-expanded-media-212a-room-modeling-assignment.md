## Assignment Deliverables

1. 3D Model file of scale model of Sculpture + Expanded Media Room 212A (`.blend`, `.mb`, `.ma`, `.skp`)
   - Label File YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname room 212A model
2. Minimum of 2 rendered images of room 212A (`.png`, .`jpg`)
   - Label Files YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname room 212A render

## Overview

Use measurements taken from the physical space, photos, fSpy, and available floor plans to create and accurate 3D digital model of the Sculpture + Expanded Media Room 212A. Add materials and textures to the elements in the room. [Blenderkit](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/install-blenderkit-blender.md) isa good source of materials, textures, doors, windows, and other 3d objects to use in your room model. If you apply a texture to an object, make sure to UV unwap it.

## Additional Resources

Taking a photo from the room, matching the camera in fSpy, importing the camera to Blender, and then scaling the camera around the 3D cursor is a good way to get a believable camera and angle for making renders.
