## Overview

This introduction to site plans and floor plans, focuses on their use in planning and executing exhibitions, sculpture projects, and site-specific installations. Site plans show a top down view of a buildings and the surroundings. Floor plans show a top down 2D representations of interior spaces. Understanding some common symbols and notations for architectural elements like walls, doors, and windows will help students learn to read and interpret basic site plans and floor plans. Emphasis is placed on reading dimensions and scale accurately so art projects are proposed, planned, and executed with precision.

Creating accurate 3D digital models from 2D plans, allows artists to visualize spaces more effectively and make it easier to present compelling proposals by placing scale models of their conceptual art projects within these 3D digital spaces. 3D modeling aids in ideation by showing how a particular work fits into specific environments, assessing factors like light, space, and audience flow. Modeling also plays a crucial role in the fabrication process, helping to identify and solve potential issues before physical construction begins and keep track of complex projects during fabrication and installation.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the difference between site plans and floor plans
- Understand the basics of 2D floor plans
- Read the dimensions and scale from site plans and floor plans
- Create a scale 3D digital model from a 2D site plan or floor plan
- Place scale conceptual art projects and installations inside 3D models of site plans and floor plans for aiding in ideation and fabrication of complex artworks
