## Overview

Students continue clean up their structured light 3D scan models. Using tools in Blender and / or Fusion 360, undercuts are identified and either modified or molded around. Parting lines are created to define the parts of the mold and to allow the final cast to be released from the mold. Digital 3D modeling tools perform the undercut analysis and mold separation. After the pieces are separated at the parting lines, the mold parts are hollowed out to the outside of the form to create a negative volume. These negative volumes are 3D printed in preparation for casting plaster to make a useable slip cast mold.

- identify and resolve undercuts
- determine parting lines and pieces of a multi-part mold
- use digital 3d modeling tools to make mold parts
- hollow out mold parts in preparation for 3D printing

## Key Terms
