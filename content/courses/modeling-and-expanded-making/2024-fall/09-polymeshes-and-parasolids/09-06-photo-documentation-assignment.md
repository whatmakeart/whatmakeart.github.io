## Assignment Overview

Documentation of work for presentation to others is a vital skill for creators. Most people will not see a work in person and therefore will rely on the documentation to experience the piece. Compelling documentation can be the difference between someone liking a work or disregarding it.

High quality photos can be taken with a bare minimum photography setup. This setup is easily achieved with materials most have on hand, a single light, a piece of cardboard, a neutral background, a piece of white paper for a reflector, and a cell phone camera. Individually these items are common, but with a little thought and effort applied, they can be combined to make decent art documentation photos. Using additional lights and larger sensor manual cameras allow even more control over the documentation photos.
