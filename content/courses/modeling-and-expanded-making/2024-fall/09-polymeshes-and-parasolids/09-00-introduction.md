## Overview

Students work together to setup a paper backdrop and photography lights to [document their 3D artwork](./09-05-how-to-document-3d-artwork.md) from the previous project. Photos should be taken as Raw images and jpgs. Students then post process their raw photographs to correct exposure, lighting, and appearance.

Students continue to process their 3D Structured Light scans from the Artec LEO. Import the scan OBJ into Blender and then use the sculpting tools to clean up the mesh.
