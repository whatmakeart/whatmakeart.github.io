## Overview

[Photogrammetry](../../../../3d-modeling/photogrammetry.md) is a useful tool for capturing 3D Geometry and visual texture information from the real physical world. It is accessible with little more than a cell phone camera needed for compelling results. While purpose built, industrial photogrammetry rigs and workflows can achieve a high level of accuracy, general photogrammetry often produces stunning visual textures but underwhelming 3D geometry.

[3D Scanning](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-scanning.md) with Lidar Scanners and Structured Light scanners offer more precision than photogrammetry. Lidar shoots light out and waits for the return bounce of the light from the object. It calculates the position of different points of the objects based on the travel time of emitted light to create a point cloud. This is similar to radar.
