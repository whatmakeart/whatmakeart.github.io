## Overview

Ideation sketches, mockups, prototypes, proposals, and preliminary designs can all benefit from compelling visualizations. 3D tools such as photo camera matching, rendering, and 3D model compositing can often create higher quality visualizations of projects in less time than traditional analog methods or even digital collage.

## Lerning Objectives

- Install fSpy photo matching software
- Use 1 point, 2 point, and 3 point perspective to match photo perspective
- Use Blender or Maya to create a basic 3D model from a photo match
- Project textures from photo onto a 3D model
- Use rendering tools to composite a conceptual sculpture into a 3D photo matched scene
