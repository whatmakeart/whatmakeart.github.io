## Exercise Deliverables

1. Export an STL or OBJ or STEP of your cleaned up mesh from the in class mesh generation exercise.
   - Label the file 20240821 Lastname Firstname name of mesh.stl

If exporting an STL or OBJ from Blender, make sure to subdivide the mesh multiple times so there is enough geometry to make it smooth. Select shade flat in object mode to see how the mesh looks.

- [Export STL Maya](../../../../digital-fabrication/3d-printing/export-stl-maya.md)

## 1 Clean Up Generated Mesh for 3D Printing

1. Select an interesting mesh and open it in a 3D modeling program.
2. Edit and modify the mesh with sculpting and other 3D modeling tools.
3. Save the edited version as an OBJ or STL if using a mesh modeling program, or as a STEP if using a parametric solid modeling program.

## 2 Create New Mesh for 3D Printing

Some images convert to relatively good 3D meshes. Other images produce an unusable mess. Create a new 3D mesh with the modeling program of your choice.

1. Keep the spirit of simple 3D forms that can be quickly modeled.
2. You can even use the same reference images.
3. Save the and label the mesh file.

## Slice Meshes and 3D Print with Bambu Studio

Using Bambu Studio, students will slice their 3D objects and combine them into printable 3mf project files.

AI mesh generation uses trained models to generate a 3D mesh from a 2D source image or a text prompt. This technology does not currently produce high quality meshes but it is important to be aware of ongoing developments in the field in order to take advantage of them in your artistic practice.

## AI Mesh Generation Tools

### Adobe

- [Adobe Substance 3D Stager](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d/apps/stager.html) - Text to 3D Mesh generator inside Adobe Substance Stager

### GitHub and Hugging Face

- [PartCrafter](https://wgsxm.github.io/projects/partcrafter/) - generates multi-part meshes from images
- [Hunyuan 3D](https://hunyuan-3d.com/) - generates 3d meshs and textures from images and text
- [InstandMesh](https://github.com/TencentARC/InstantMesh) - generates 3D mesh from single image
- [VFusion3D Demo on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/VFusion3D) - Makes good videos but the meshes are blocky
- [VFusion3D Demo on Google Colab](https://github.com/whatmakeart/VFusion3D-colab) - Requires access to Google Drive
- [StableVision123 Demo on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/p4vv37/Stable-Zero123)

## In Class Exercise

1. Use images and photos of objects and the mesh generation tools above to create 3D meshes.
2. Try images made with AI image generators for different results.
3. Save and label your mesh files.
