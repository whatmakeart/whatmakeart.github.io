## Overview

This course introduces students to a wide range of 3D content creation processes including, [3D modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md), [photogrammetry](../../../../3d-modeling/photogrammetry-software.md), lidar scanning, AI mesh creation, [mesh modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/polygon-mesh-3d-modeling-basics.md) [parametric solid modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/parametric-modeling.md), rendering, animation, [3D printing](../../../../digital-fabrication/3d-printing/3d-printing.md), [laser cutting](../../../../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting/laser-cutting.md), [CNC machining](../../../../digital-fabrication/cnc/cnc-basics.md), [photo matching](../../../../3d-modeling/photo-perspective-matching-with-fspy.md), and prototyping.

Beginning with a brief survey of various 3D modeling programs and mesh generation tools, students then make small 3D models to 3D print in class. Students explore how to use 3D modeling for ideation and quick physical output

## Learning Objectives

- Identify 3D modeling software for parametric, mesh, and sculpting
- Use AI mesh generation tools to generate 3D meshes from 2D images
- Refine 3D meshes or models for 3D printing
- Use Bambu Studio to slice and print 3D models
- Create a scale digital 3D model of a physical object
- Use 3D modeling software to ideate different sculptural configurations
- Create renders of potential sculptures
