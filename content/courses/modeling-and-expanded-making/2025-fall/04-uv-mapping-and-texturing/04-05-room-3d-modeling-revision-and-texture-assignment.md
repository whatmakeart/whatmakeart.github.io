## Assignment Deliverables

1. 3D Model file of interior space (`.blend`, `.mb`, `.ma`, `.skp`)
   - Label File YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname interior space model
2. Minimum of 2 rendered images of room 212A (`.png`, .`jpg`)
   - Label Files YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname interior space render

## Overview

Reveiw the model and renders of Room 212A from the [previous assignment](../03-floor-plan-to-3d-model/03-06-sculpture-and-expanded-media-room-212a-modeling-exercise-assignment.md).

Visit the real room with your laptop and a notebook. Note features that are in the room but not in your model, write them down. Note measurements that you may not have in your model. Take new measurements and write them down.

Use measurements taken from the physical space, photos, fSpy, and available floor plans to create and accurate 3D digital model of the Sculpture + Expanded Media Room 212A. Add materials and textures to the elements in the room. [Blenderkit](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/install-blenderkit-blender.md) isa good source of materials, textures, doors, windows, and other 3d objects to use in your room model. If you apply a texture to an object, make sure to UV unwap it.

## Additional Resources

Taking a photo from the room, matching the camera in fSpy, importing the camera to Blender, and then scaling the camera around the 3D cursor is a good way to get a believable camera and angle for making renders.
