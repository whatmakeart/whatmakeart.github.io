## Overview

Students use rapid prototyping tools and 3D modeling to quickly test and iterate variations and solve issues with the projects in preparation for final production, fabrication and assembly.

It is expected that some iterations will not work. The only way to find out is to make the thing and see. This is an essential part of the creative process and the design process.

## Learning Objectives

- Use 3D modeling software to design and digitally prototype project components.
- Operate rapid prototyping tools, such as 3D printers or laser cutters, to fabricate physical models for testing.
- Analyze physical prototypes to identify specific design flaws, assembly issues, or material limitations.
- Evaluate the results of "failed" iterations and make design modifications.
