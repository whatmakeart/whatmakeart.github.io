## Overview

3D visualization is a multi-step process that often starts with 3D modeling and rendering but also includes post-processing steps such as compositing and color grading.

Ideation sketches, mockups, prototypes, proposals, and preliminary designs can all benefit from compelling 3D visualizations. 3D tools such as photo camera matching, rendering, and 3D model compositing can often create higher quality visualizations of projects in less time than traditional analog methods or even digital collage.

## Learning Objectives

- Install fSpy photo matching software
- Use 1 point, 2 point, and 3 point perspective to match photo perspective
- Use Blender or Maya to create a basic 3D model from a photo match
- Project textures from photo onto a 3D model
- Use rendering tools to composite a conceptual sculpture into a 3D photo matched scene
