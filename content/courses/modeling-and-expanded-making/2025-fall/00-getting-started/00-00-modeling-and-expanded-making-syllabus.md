## Course Description

Planning large-scale, site-specific installations, creating compelling proposals for public commissions, and making models to test ideas all require 3D Modeling. Students will have 3D modeling tools right next to their paper sketchbooks, scissors, table saws, CNCs, and 3D printers. Practice in types of 3D modeling software solidifies fundamental modeling and visualization concepts and techniques. Workshops in 3D design sketching, rendering, solid modeling, architectural site modeling, 3D printing, CNC machining, and laser cutting cultivate a fluid integration of 3D modeling and digital fabrication into a contemporary sculpture and expanded media studio practice. Open to all majors. The course reinforces the production of high-quality documentation of artwork for presentation at venues, portfolios, and proposals. Reviews file management, digital workflows, and digital literacy. Course structure consists of introductory concept lectures, technical instruction, lab time with guidance and group critique of finished assignments.

## Course Goals and Learning Objectives

Upon completion of the course, students will have to opportunity to:

- Demonstrate advantages and disadvantages of different 3D modeling tools
- Determine the most appropriate 3D modeling tools for a particular project or task in the studio
- Create new work using digital fabrication techniques including CNC machining, laser cutting, 3D printing, and water jet cutting
- Produce compelling project proposal imagery with 3D modeling tools and renderers
- Incorporate the Fabrication Studios and think\[box\] to create artwork
- Organize files and digital resources for complex studio projects
- Design site-specific installations with accurate dimensions using 3D modeling
- Operate digital cameras to capture high quality, visual documentation of completed projects
- Post-process visual documentation with software tools for presentation and display

### Additional Topics

- Real-World Scale 3D Scanning and Fitting
- Preparing Submissions for Public Art RFPs
- High-Quality Visual Documentation and Presentation

## Course Organization / Method of Instruction

- This course has 4.5 hours of regularly scheduled instructional time. In addition to the regularly scheduled instructional time, you’ll need to plan on 4.5 hours of preparation and homework time for each of your classes.
- This course is a combination of studio work as well as lecture, group dialogue, critiques etc.
- Projects will sometimes have in-progress reviews in addition to critiques when the projects are finished. The instructor as well as students participate in the critiques and is part of the studio learning experience and a big part of the course.
- Students must avoid behavior that disrupts the learning process, or that otherwise may be offensive to classmates, or that is disrespectful to the instructor.

### CIA Course Attendance Policy from the College Catalog

#### Course Attendance

Students are expected to attend all sessions of the classes in which they are registered and to attend all associated lecture programs and meetings. Progress as an artist depends not only on completion of assignments but also on full participation in dialogue with studio and academic classes. All absences will count towards a student’s absence total for the semester unless approved as an extenuating circumstance absence by the Dean of Students. Students are responsible for all missed class material, including assignments and tests, when absent from class. Each faculty member is required to take, and to maintain records of, class attendance. CIA’s absence limits are as follows:

<div class="responsive-table-markdown">

| **Course Type**             | **Absence Limit\***                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Course meeting once a week  | No more than 3 absences per semester\*\*                                               |
| Course meeting twice a week | No more than 6 absences per semester                                                   |
| Independent Study           | Participation and attendance expectations are at the discretion of the faculty member. |

</div>

_\* Faculty may factor tardiness into determining if a student is absent. Tardiness policies should be stated on the course syllabus._
_\*\* note: for studio courses that meet in 2 sessions over 1 day, missing one of the two sessions will be counted as 0.5 absence_

**To uphold the integrity of the educational content and curricula, absences exceeding the limits as outlined above will result in failure of the course in which the absences occurred.** A student who exceeds the absence limit in any class should meet with their Academic Advisor to discuss the impact of the course failure on their academic progress.

**An absence from a final critique or exam will result in automatic failure of the project or exam.**

#### Notification of Absences

For pre-planned absences, students must notify their faculty member that they will be absent. For absences due to unforeseen circumstance, students should contact their faculty member as soon as possible before or after the absence occurs. To protect a student’s privacy, evidence of an illness, injury, obituary and any other documentation of an absence are not required, requested, or accepted by faculty.

#### Absence Due to Religious Observance

Students who plan to be absent due to religious observances should notify their faculty members at least 2 weeks prior to the pre-planned absence. These absences count against the absence limit and students are responsible for all missed work.

#### Absence Due to Extenuating Circumstances

The absence limits as described above, are adequate for minor illnesses, doctor’s appointments, transportation issues, weather concerns and other instances that are not exceptionally rare and unforeseen. In the case of an absence due to extenuating circumstances that a student wishes to not count against the absence limits listed above, the student must submit the [Extenuating Circumstance Absence Request Form](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7996758/Extenuating-Circumstance-Absence-Request-Form) within 10 calendar days (limited exceptions apply) of the absence for review by the Dean of Students. The use of this form should be extremely limited as most absences do not qualify as extenuating.

Extenuating circumstances are generally defined as exceptionally rare, unforeseen, and short-term circumstances which may cause a student to be absent from class. These terms are defined as follows:

- Exceptionally rare is defined as a circumstance that is markedly different from the student’s usual daily life activities.
- Unforeseen is defined as a circumstance that is outside of the student’s control and was not preventable. This includes the student’s responsibility for making a reasonable attempt at utilizing Institute-provided resources, policies and procedures available to assist in their success.
- Short-term is defined as a circumstance that is temporary and will not require on-going intervention past a reasonable time period.

Upon receiving the Extenuating Circumstance Absence Request Form, the Dean of Students will make a determination as to the classification of the absence as approved or not approved or will request additional outstanding/clarification information from the student. The student and faculty member(s) will be notified via CIA email of the determination no later than 10 calendar days after the request and all necessary information is received by the Dean of Students. Sharing of information impacting the decision will be at the sole discretion of the Dean of Students and will prioritize student privacy and dignity. If an absence is deemed approved as an extenuating circumstance, it will not be counted in the absence limits noted above and the student will be responsible for all missed work and course requirements for the approved date(s). The student will be required to make arrangements with the faculty member(s) to determine a reasonable timeline for completing missed work and course requirements for the approved date(s). This timeline will be at the sole discretion of the faculty member.

In the case of an absence submitted via the Extenuating Circumstance Absence Request Form which is determined to be not approved by the Dean of Students, the student may file an appeal with the Vice President of Academic Affairs + Provost within 3 calendar days on specific grounds. Disagreement with the decision alone is not sufficient for an appeal. Appeals must be submitted via CIA email to [gwatts@cia.edu](mailto:gwatts@cia.edu) with [rasauber@cia.edu](mailto:rasauber@cia.edu) copied and must include the student’s name and ID number and must indicate on which ground the student believes the decision should be appealed (options below):

1. Through no fault of the student, Information/documentation pertinent to the decision was missing at the time of the decision. Note: The student will be required to submit the additional information/documentation as part of the appeal along with an explanation of why the information/documentation was not provided in the original request.
2. Through no fault of the student, Institute policy was not followed and had a direct impact on the decision at the time of the decision. Note The student will be required to identify which policy was not followed, documentation showing the policy was not followed, and a description of how the decision may have been different if policy had been followed.

Upon receiving an appeal request, the Vice President of Academic Affairs + Provost will make a determination as to the classification of the original decision as upheld or overturned or will request additional outstanding/clarification information from the student. The student, faculty member(s), and Dean of Students will be notified via CIA email of the determination no later than 10 calendar days after the request and all necessary information is received by the Vice President of Academic Affairs + Provost. Decisions that are overturned will result in the absence being classified as extenuating and the absence will not be counted in the absence limits noted above and the student will be responsible for all missed work and course requirements for the approved date(s). The student will be required to make arrangements with the faculty member(s) to determine a reasonable timeline for completing missed work and course requirements for the approved date(s). This timeline will be at the sole discretion of the faculty member. Decisions that are upheld will maintain an absence classification as not approved. All appeal decisions are final and binding.

##### Important Notes:

- Students receiving approved extenuating circumstance absences are not guaranteed to pass their courses.
- Students are able to fail a course due to exceeding the absence limits beyond approved extenuating circumstance absences.
- Students are able to fail a course due to not completing course requirements regardless of approved extenuating circumstance absences.
- Students are encouraged to meet with their faculty members and Academic Advisor to discuss their options for success in their courses when they are experiencing absences (whether due to extenuating circumstances or otherwise).

#### Extracurricular Life and Class Attendance

At CIA, we value students' total educational experience, including its curricular, co-curricular, and extracurricular components. All departments, academic and other, are encouraged to minimize the scheduling during established class meeting hours of events at which student participation is required or desired, including but not limited to extra class meetings, professional development opportunities, field trips, and other organized activities. When conflicts exist, all parties (students, faculty, and staff) should work together so that the student can meet their academic obligations and participate in extracurricular events. If agreement about an appropriate accommodation cannot be reached, the student's obligations to classes meeting on their posted schedules will take priority.

### Class Trips Policy from the College Catalog

All students attending instruction-related trips or tours that require them to travel away from CIA must sign an approved release form in advance of the trip that declares they will not make a claim against the college or its personnel/representatives for injury or damage sustained while on the trip. Release forms should be returned to the faculty member leading the trip before the event. All CIA policies are in effect during sponsored excursions away from campus.

### CIA Grading Policies and Grade Descriptions from the College Catalog

Letter grades are a means by which faculty members communicate their professional assessment of students’ work. The primary purpose of assigning grades is to provide a realistic standard of reference by which students can measure their progress while enrolled at CIA.

Grades are reported twice each semester: mid-term grades after the first eight weeks, and final grades at the close of the term. The mid-term grade is a preliminary indication of progress to date.

Semester and cumulative grade point averages are reviewed by Academic Services each term to determine each student’s academic status. Each transcript includes the semester Grade Point Average (GPA) and the cumulative GPA. Letter grades have the following meaning:

**A, A-:** Work of consistently outstanding quality, which displays originality, and often goes beyond course requirements;

**B+, B, B-:** Work of consistently good quality, demonstrating a high level of proficiency, knowledge, and skills in all aspects of the course;

**C+, C, C-:** Satisfactory work that meets the requirements of the course and conforms to the standards for graduation.

**D+, D, D-:** Work deficient in concept or execution but acceptable for course credit in all courses.

**F:** Work unacceptable for course credit and does not meet the standards for graduation.

### CIA Policy on Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty excerpted from the Student Handbook:

All acts of academic dishonesty diminish the integrity of the Institute and are taken very seriously by the school. Students being accused of Academic Dishonestly will participate in our judicial process and if found responsible, will be subject to appropriate sanctions. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to any one or a combination of the following:

- Formal warning/censure/academic alert.
- Reduced grade including a failing grade for the assignment.
- Reduced grade including a failing grade for the entire course.
- Forfeiture of student leadership positions, and/or restrictions on participation in Institute activities.
- Academic probation
- Suspension
- Expulsion from the Institute.

#### CIA Course Evaluation Policy

All students are expected to fill out a brief course evaluation for each class at the end of the semester. Your participation in the course evaluation process is critical to CIA’s evaluation of faculty teaching, assessment of student learning outcomes, and identification of opportunities for continuous improvement to course content and instruction. Please take a moment to respond to the evaluation when directed to do so at the end of the semester. Your thoughts matter.
