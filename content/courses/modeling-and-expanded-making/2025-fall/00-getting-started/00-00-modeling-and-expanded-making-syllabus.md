## Course Description

Planning large-scale, site-specific installations, creating compelling proposals for public commissions, and making models to test ideas all require 3D Modeling. Students will have 3D modeling tools right next to their paper sketchbooks, scissors, table saws, CNCs, and 3D printers. Practice in types of 3D modeling software solidifies fundamental modeling and visualization concepts and techniques. Workshops in 3D design sketching, rendering, solid modeling, architectural site modeling, 3D printing, CNC machining, and laser cutting cultivate a fluid integration of 3D modeling and digital fabrication into a contemporary sculpture and expanded media studio practice. Open to all majors. The course reinforces the production of high-quality documentation of artwork for presentation at venues, portfolios, and proposals. Reviews file management, digital workflows, and digital literacy. Course structure consists of introductory concept lectures, technical instruction, lab time with guidance and group critique of finished assignments.

## Course Goals and Learning Objectives

Upon completion of the course, students will have to opportunity to:

- Demonstrate advantages and disadvantages of different 3D modeling tools
- Determine the most appropriate 3D modeling tools for a particular project or task in the studio
- Create new work using digital fabrication techniques including CNC machining, laser cutting, 3D printing, and water jet cutting
- Produce compelling project proposal imagery with 3D modeling tools and renderers
- Incorporate the Fabrication Studios and think\[box\] to create artwork
- Organize files and digital resources for complex studio projects
- Design site-specific installations with accurate dimensions using 3D modeling
- Operate digital cameras to capture high quality, visual documentation of completed projects
- Post-process visual documentation with software tools for presentation and display

## Course Organization / Method of Instruction

- This course has 4.5 hours of regularly scheduled instructional time. In addition to the regularly scheduled instructional time, you’ll need to plan on 4 to 6 hours of homework time for each of your classes.
- This course is a combination of studio work as well as lecture, group dialogue, critiques etc.
- Projects will sometimes have in-progress reviews in addition to critiques when the projects are finished. The Instructor as well as students participate in the critiques. This takes time and is part of the studio learning experience and a big part of the course.
- Students must avoid behavior that disrupts the learning process, or that otherwise may be offensive to classmates, or that is disrespectful to the instructor.

### Additional Topics

- Real-World Scale 3D Scanning and Fitting
- Preparing Submissions for Public Art RFPs
- High-Quality Visual Documentation and Presentation

## Course Policies and Expectations

### Critiques

You’re required to contribute to all critiques, even if your own project is not complete. Successful crits depend on each student’s generosity in sharing their honest thoughts, opinions and suggestions.

- [How to Critique Art](../../../../art-faq/how-to-critique-art.md)
- [Art School Critique No, No's](../../../../art-faq/art-school-critique-no-nos.md)

### Late Work

Projects must be turned in on time. On time is before the beginning of class on the day that they are due or other time as specified by the instructor. Late projects will automatically drop 1% per day late with a maximum reduction to 60% of the total possible points.

### Documentation

- Students should maintain regular, on-going and timely documentation of work in progress.
- Images should be high resolution, well exposed, in focus, and well composed.

### File Management

- We will use [Canvas to turn in assignments](https://cia.instructure.com/courses/2096).
- Use this format for naming all your class digital files:

### CIA Course Attendance Policy from the College Catalog

#### Course Attendance

Students are expected to attend all sessions of the classes in which they are registered and to attend all associated lecture programs and meetings. Progress as an artist depends not only on completion of assignments but also on full participation in dialogue with studio and academic classes. All absences will count towards a student’s absence total for the semester. Students are responsible for all missed class material, including assignments and tests, when absent from class. Each faculty member is required to take, and to maintain records of, class attendance. CIA’s absence limits are as follows:

<div class="responsive-table-markdown">

| **Course Type**             | **Absence Limit**                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Course meeting once a week  | No more than 3 absences per semester\*\*                                               |
| Course meeting twice a week | No more than 6 absences per semester                                                   |
| Independent Study           | Participation and attendance expectations are at the discretion of the faculty member. |

</div>

_\* note: for studio courses that meet in 2 sessions over 1 day, missing one of the two sessions will be counted as 0.5 absence_

A student who has missed the maximum absences per semester, as outlined above, must meet with their Academic Advisor to discuss their options. **To uphold the integrity of the educational content and curricula, absences exceeding the limit as outlined above will result in failure of the course.** Students must notify their faculty member if they will miss a class, and should contact their instructor(s) as soon as possible after an unavoidable absence. To protect a student’s privacy, written documentation of an illness, injury or obituary is not required nor requested. **An absence from a final critique or exam will result in automatic failure of the project or exam.**

Faculty may factor tardiness into determining if a student is absent or not. Tardiness policies should be stated on the course syllabus.

#### Absence Due to Religious Observance

Students who expect to miss classes or activities due to religious observances should notify their faculty members well before the expected absence. Students are responsible for the missed work.

#### Absence Due to Extenuating Circumstances

The absence limits as described above, are adequate for emergencies, minor illnesses, doctor’s appointments, transportation issues, etc. In the case of exceptional circumstances that would cause a student to exceed the absence limit, the student should contact Academic Services. A student who is hospitalized or has an extended illness is asked to give HIPPA permission to their academic advisor in Academic Services so they can communicate with their medical provider regarding the student’s illness and assist as needed. When protracted absence has been caused by illness or other extenuating circumstance, students may be given the privilege of making up lost work by arrangement with, and at the discretion of the instructor. Students approved to exceed the absence limit due to exceptional circumstances are still responsible for completion of any course requirements missed during their absence.

#### Extracurricular Life and Class Attendance

At CIA, we value students' total educational experience, including its curricular, co-curricular, and extracurricular components. All departments, academic and other, are encouraged to minimize the scheduling during established class meeting hours of events at which student participation is required or desired, including but not limited to extra class meetings, professional development opportunities, field trips, and other organized activities. When conflicts exist, all parties (students, faculty, and staff) should work together so that the student can meet their academic obligations and participate in extracurricular events. If agreement about an appropriate accommodation cannot be reached, the student's obligations to classes meeting on their posted schedules will take priority.

### Class Trips Policy from the College Catalog

All students attending instruction-related trips or tours that require them to travel away from CIA must sign an approved release form in advance of the trip that declares they will not make a claim against the college or its personnel/representatives for injury or damage sustained while on the trip. Release forms should be returned to the faculty member leading the trip before the event. All CIA policies are in effect during sponsored excursions away from campus.

### CIA Grading Policies and Grade Descriptions from the College Catalog

Letter grades are a means by which faculty members communicate their professional assessment of students’ work. The primary purpose of assigning grades is to provide a realistic standard of reference by which students can measure their progress while enrolled at CIA.

Grades are reported twice each semester: mid-term grades after the first eight weeks, and final grades at the close of the term. The mid-term grade is a preliminary indication of progress to date.

Semester and cumulative grade point averages are reviewed by Academic Services each term to determine each student’s academic status. Each transcript includes the semester Grade Point Average (GPA) and the cumulative GPA. Letter grades have the following meaning:

**A, A-:** Work of consistently outstanding quality, which displays originality, and often goes beyond course requirements;

**B+, B, B-:** Work of consistently good quality, demonstrating a high level of proficiency, knowledge, and skills in all aspects of the course;

**C+, C, C-:** Satisfactory work that meets the requirements of the course and conforms to the standards for graduation.

**D+, D, D-:** Work deficient in concept or execution but acceptable for course credit in all courses.

**F:** Work unacceptable for course credit and does not meet the standards for graduation.

### CIA Policy on Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty excerpted from the Student Handbook:

All acts of academic dishonesty diminish the integrity of the Institute and are taken very seriously by the school. Students being accused of Academic Dishonestly will participate in our judicial process and if found responsible, will be subject to appropriate sanctions. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to any one or a combination of the following:

- Formal warning/censure/academic alert.
- Reduced grade including a failing grade for the assignment.
- Reduced grade including a failing grade for the entire course.
- Forfeiture of student leadership positions, and/or restrictions on participation in Institute activities.
- Academic probation
- Suspension
- Expulsion from the Institute.

#### CIA Course Evaluation Policy

All students are expected to fill out a brief course evaluation for each class at the end of the semester. Your participation in the course evaluation process is critical to CIA’s evaluation of faculty teaching, assessment of student learning outcomes, and identification of opportunities for continuous improvement to course content and instruction. Please take a moment to respond to the evaluation when directed to do so at the end of the semester. Your thoughts matter.
