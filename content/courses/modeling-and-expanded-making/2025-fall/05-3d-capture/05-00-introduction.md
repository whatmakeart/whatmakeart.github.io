## Overview

[Photogrammetry](./05-02-photogrammetry.md) is a useful tool for capturing 3D Geometry and visual texture information from the real physical world. [3D Scanning](./05-01-3d-scanning.md) is able to capture more detail and more accurate geometry than photogrammetry, but requires more expensive 3D scanning equipment and software. [Gaussian Splatting](./05-03-gaussian-splatting.md) is a method of using "splats" or gaussian "smears" to rebuild a 3D scene rather than a mesh.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify differences between photogrammetry, LiDAR scanning, and structured light scanning, and gaussian splatting
- Capture an interior room or an object with photogrammetry
- Process the photogrammetric data into a 3D mesh
- Capture a 3D scan with a structured light scanner
- Process the raw data from a 3d Scan into a 3D mesh
- Clean up a 3D captured mesh in mesh modeling software
- Create a render image from 3D capture sources
- 3D print from 3D capture data
