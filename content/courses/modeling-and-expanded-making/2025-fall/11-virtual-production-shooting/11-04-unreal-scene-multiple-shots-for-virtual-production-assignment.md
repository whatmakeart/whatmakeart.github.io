## Assignment Overview

1. Create an Unreal Project with the disguise RenderStream plugin added.
2. Continue to build out your scene with assets from Fab and self built assets. None of the default unreal checkerboard or mountains or sky should be visible.
3. Create a minimum of 4 distinct camera positions or shots. [Shot Types Reference](../../../../video/shot-types.md)
   - Establishing Shot
   - Full Shot
   - Medium Shot
   - Closeup
4. The four distinct shots can saved in individual level sequences or saved with Hold Keyframes on a single Level Sequence timeline, or as shots in a level sequence.
5. Take screenshots of each shot.
6. Label the shots and upload to the LMS.
7. Save your Unreal Scene and entire project folder in a retrievable location such as cloud storage or a usb drive.

### Challenge Shots

As a non-required challenge, create animated camera shots. These could be dolly tracking shots or even virtual drone shots over your created environment. These can be rendered out and uses in virtual production or in the final production as a super wide establishing shot.
