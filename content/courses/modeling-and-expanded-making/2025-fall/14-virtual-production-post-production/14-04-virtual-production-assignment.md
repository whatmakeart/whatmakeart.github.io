1. Project description and self-assessment
   - Label file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname description and assessment (`.docx`, `.pdf`)

## Assignment Overview

Virtual production like many creative workflows, benefits from multiple people working together. Even in a simple shoot, one person might be controlling when footage is captured to disk, another might be pulling focus, a third will move and control the camera, and one more is stationed at the lighting console. This doesn't even account for any talent to be in the virtual production.

While it _is_ possible to make content with virtual production as a solo endeavor, it can take more time and present challenges that are alleviated when working with a team. For this project everyone in the class will help out during the vp shoots to help with focus, recording lighting, props, etc,

You may but are not required to collaborate and pool resources for:

- Creating Unreal Engine environments
- Setting up shots and transitions
- Developing a narrative (if one exists)
- Sharing assets, previsualization, and technical setups

Each student still turns in the project. The final video may be from the same source material but each student should make their own edit and final video export. Each student should also write their own written description / self-assessment, even if you collaborate on the shoot.

### Requirements

- Combine a minimum of 2 shots from the XR studio into a single video
- Edit the video in a creative and intentional way by adjusting the visuals, framing, transitions, exposure, color
- Add sound / music / audio
- Consider rendering video from Unreal Engine to create wider establishing shots and scene transitions
