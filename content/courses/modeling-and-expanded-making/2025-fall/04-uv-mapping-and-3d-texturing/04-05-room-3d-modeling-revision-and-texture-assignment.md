## Assignment Deliverables

1. 3D Model file of interior space (`.blend`, `.mb`, `.ma`, `.skp`)
   - Label File YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname interior space model
2. Minimum of 2 rendered images of room 212A (`.png`, .`jpg`)
   - Label Files YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname interior space render

## Overview

Select one of the assignment options below. Follow the specified parameters for your selected option and upload a 3D model file and 2 render images.

### Option A - Stupendously More Amazing 3D Model of Room 212A

1. Review the model and renders of Room 212A from the [previous assignment](../03-floor-plan-to-3d-model/03-06-sculpture-and-expanded-media-room-212a-modeling-exercise-assignment.md).
2. Revisit the real room with your laptop and a notebook.
3. Note features that are in the room but not in your model, write them down.
4. Note measurements that you may not have in your model. Take new measurements and write them down.
5. Revise your digital 3D model with this new information.
6. Place a sculptural object in the room.
7. Create 2 different render images of the space.

### Option B - Escape into a 3D Model of a New Room

1. Select a new room that you have physical access to.
2. Draw a floor plan of the space, making note of prominent features and locations requiring measurements.
3. Use measurements taken from the physical space, photos, fSpy, and potentially available floor plans to create and accurate 3D digital model of the space.
4. Add materials and textures to the elements in the room.
5. Place a sculptural object in the room.
6. Create 2 different render images of the space.

### Option C - Rooms? Where We're Going We Don't Need Rooms

Design and layout a new conceptual room. This interior space is only limited by your vision but to make it presentation convincing, use realistic and reasonable scale for objects such as doors, windows, and chairs. A lack of realism in imagined 3D spaces is often caused by a lack of convincing scale and proportions of objects.

1. Make a list of common features in your room and research real world dimensions to use in your model.
   - [Commercial Door Height](https://www.google.com/search?q=commercial+door+height)
   - [window Dimensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=window+dimensions)
   - [Desk Height](https://www.google.com/search?q=desk+height)
   - [Commercial Ceiling Light Dimensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=commercial+ceiling+light+dimensions)
2. Create a detailed 3D model of your room vision.
3. Add materials and textures to the elements in the room.
4. Place a sculptural object in the room.
5. Create 2 different render images of the space.

## Assignment Resources

[Blenderkit](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/install-blenderkit-blender.md) is a good source of materials, textures, doors, windows, and other 3d objects to use in your room model. If you apply a texture to an object, make sure to UV unwrap it.
