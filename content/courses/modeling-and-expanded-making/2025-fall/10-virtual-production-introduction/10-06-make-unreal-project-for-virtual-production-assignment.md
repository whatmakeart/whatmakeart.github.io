- [10.04 Fab Environment to disguise RenderStream Setup Unreal 5.5.4](10-04-fab-environment-to-disguise-renderstream-setup-unreal-5-5-4%20copy.md)

It is recommended that you add objects and elements to your scene based on your ideas and desired environment.

### Requirements

- Create and save a Level

- Add 3 Cine Camera Actors parented to the Camera Root Actor
- Add the _RenderStream Channel Definition_ to the Cine Camera Actors

- Take a screenshot of the level showing the correctly added RenderStream Channel Definition and Cine Camera actors
  - Note: The above guides use `RS_Main_Cam`, `RS_OOF_Cam`, `RS_AR_Cam` for names of the Cine Camera Actors. You can use these names or you can use the the names from your disguise template which may be different.
