## Overview

This week [Raúl Romero](../03-installation-light-with-hepp-maccoy/03-02-raúl-romero.md) will visit class and work with students on the sound portion of the installation. This is week four of the installation ideation process. The goal this week is to collaborate on a final installation design. Some details may change along the way but broad strokes should be decided. We will also select an exhibition title based on the revised 1/24 scale models and ideations.
