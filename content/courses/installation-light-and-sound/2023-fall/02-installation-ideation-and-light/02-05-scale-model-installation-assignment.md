title: Scale Model of Installation
---

## Assignment Deliverables

- 1/24 scale physical prototype installation made inside scale model of gallery
- Upload 3 simulated point of view photos taken with cell phone or other camera that can fit in the gallery model (.jpg or .png) _(Each student takes 3 photos.)_
- Upload a brief slide presentation explaining the installation model and concept. (pdf)

## Overview

After collaborating with your peers in a charette process to identify priorities for the installation, it is time to visualize possible solutions. Make note of the different parts and concerns about the installation that the class voted on. With your small group members, collaborate to design a cohesive solution. You can have discussions, make sketches, run a brainstorming session, use 3D modeling or any other way to ideate and visualize your ideas. Make sure to listen to each member. Practice "Yes, and ..." to build on others' ideas and to reach a reasonable consensus. With your small group, build a scale model of the group's conceived installation. Use the 1/24 scale model of the gallery to build your installation. YOu can use cardboard, foam core, plexiglass, paint, small lights, fabric, string, wood, and any other building and fabrication material. Each member of the group should take 3 simulated point of view photos of the prototype installation as if a person was standing in the gallery. A cell phone camera or other small camera that can fit in the gallery model can be used. Make a collaborative slide presentation that presents your group's concept. Be prepared to give a presentation to Hepp Maccoy next week.

## Process

1. Identify priorities for the installation. Review the different parts and concerns about the installation that the class voted on.
2. Collaborate with your small group members to design a cohesive solution. You can have discussions, make sketches, run a brainstorming session, use 3D modeling or any other way to ideate and visualize your ideas. Make sure to listen to each member and practice "Yes, and ..." to build on others' ideas and to reach a reasonable consensus.
3. Build a scale model of the group's conceived installation. Use the 1/24 scale model of the gallery to build your installation. You can use cardboard, foam core, plexiglass, paint, small lights, fabric, string, wood, and any other building and fabrication material.
4. Take 3 simulated point of view photos of the prototype installation. A cell phone camera or other small camera that can fit in the gallery model can be used.
5. Make a collaborative slide presentation that presents your group's concept. Be prepared to give a presentation to Hepp Maccoy next week.

### Tips for visualizing possible solutions:

- Be creative and open-minded. Don't be afraid to try new things.
- Be realistic about the materials and resources you have available.
- Consider the different ways that people will interact with the installation.
- Make sure that your solution is safe and accessible to everyone.
