This week we begin fabrication of the main structures of the installation. We will review sound recordings and ideations for the central pillar structure in the gallery. The ideations and sketches will serve as a guide through fabrication. An important part of large art projects is budgeting and planning. After an idea is chosen a draft budget can show if a project is feasible with available resources. Using a spreadsheet, different parts of the project's expenses can be modified an adjusted until the most efficient budget plan is found.
