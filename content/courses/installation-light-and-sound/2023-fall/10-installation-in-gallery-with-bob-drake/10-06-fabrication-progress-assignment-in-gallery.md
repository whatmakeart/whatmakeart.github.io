## Overview

We are now in the final stages of fabrication in the gallery. The tree is moved, LEDs are on walls, but there is still a lot to do. Focus on fabricating the remaining large structures before working on details.

As you work, take photo documentation of your progress.

Write a description of:

- What you finished?
- What worked well?
- What didn't work out?
- What are the next steps?
- Other thoughts and observations.
