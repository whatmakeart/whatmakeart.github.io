To paint [paper maché](../../../../sculpture/paper-maché.md), follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your workspace.** Cover your work area with a drop cloth or old newspapers to protect it from paint.
2. **Make sure your paper mache is completely dry.** If it is still wet, the paint will not adhere properly.
3. **Apply a base coat of white acrylic gesso.** This will help the paint to go on more smoothly and evenly. Let the gesso dry completely before moving on to the next step.
4. **Choose your paints.** You can use any type of paint on paper mache, but acrylic paints are the most popular because they are easy to use and come in a wide variety of colors.
5. **Apply the paint.** Use a brush to apply the paint to your paper mache object. You can use one color or multiple colors. Be sure to let each layer of paint dry completely before applying the next layer.
6. **Add details.** Once the paint is dry, you can add details to your paper mache object using a fine-tipped brush or marker. You can also add glitter, sequins, or other embellishments.
7. **Seal your paper maché object.** Once you are happy with your painting, apply a clear acrylic sealer to protect it from dust and moisture.

Here are some additional tips for painting paper mache:

- Use a semi-dry brush when applying paint. This will help to prevent the paper mache from becoming too wet.
- Apply multiple thin coats of paint instead of one thick coat. This will help to prevent the paint from cracking or peeling.
- If you are using multiple colors, let each color dry completely before applying the next color.
- If you are adding details, use a fine-tipped brush or marker.
- To protect your finished paper mache object, apply a clear acrylic sealer.
