## Overview

[Hepp Maccoy](../02-installation-ideation-scale-model/02-03-hepp-maccoy.md) will be on site to help with the final installation of the exhibit and LED programming. To prep for the visit, wired LED strands will be tested with the PixelBlaze output expanders to make sure each DC power supply and LED wiring harness are working properly.
