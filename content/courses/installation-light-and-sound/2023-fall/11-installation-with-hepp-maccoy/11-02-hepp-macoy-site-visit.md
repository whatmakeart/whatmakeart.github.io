[Hepp](../02-installation-ideation-scale-model/02-03-hepp-maccoy.md) will be on site in class and next week to help students install LEDs and to think about how the lights will work in the exhibition. He has decades of experience installing LEDs and will lend guidance and advice to students while allowing students to follow though with their own ideas.

Students can consult with him about specific LED layout strategies and ideate and iterate on installation techniques. This is a unique opportunity for students to work with a professional artist on site after developing a relationship with the artist over the course of the semester through an initial in person site visit and three remote visits.
