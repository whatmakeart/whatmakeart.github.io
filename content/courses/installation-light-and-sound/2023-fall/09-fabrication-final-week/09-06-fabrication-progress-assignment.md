## Overview

**Spend 4.5 hours fabricating**

Make, make, make. Most of your time should be spent working on the installation, but take a few moments to snap some pictures and video of the process. After you are finished working, spend 15 - 20 minutes gathering your visual documentation.

Write a description of:

- What you finished?
- What worked well?
- What didn't work out?
- What are the next steps?
- Other thoughts and observations.
