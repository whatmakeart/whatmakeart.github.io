## Overview

This is the big day. The installation of _Forest of Memories_ opens to the public at 6:00pm on November 10, 2023. Class will be spent taking care of last minute touches and the inevitable emergency fix of LEDs, speakers, or other parts of the installation. Students will make sure the gallery is cleaned up and ready for presentation to the public. All the semester's hard work comes down to this final day. Almost there!
