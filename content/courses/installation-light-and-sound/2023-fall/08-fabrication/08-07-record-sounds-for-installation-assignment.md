## Assignment Deliverables

- Upload a minimum of 5 different categories of sounds to [labeled folders in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SdF9ipSRvBN3mYSbspl81U3n0bxDHXZy?usp=drive_link)
- Upload a written list / description of the sounds that you recorded to Canvas

## Overview

- [Google Drive Folder of Sounds](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SdF9ipSRvBN3mYSbspl81U3n0bxDHXZy?usp=drive_link)

Remember to add sounds to the folders on Google Drive. You do not need to upload sounds to Canvas but you need to upload a PDF listing the sounds that you recorded.

Remember to let the recorder go for 5 minutes or more for ambience sounds. I added a number of sounds from Adobe’s free sound effects archive to get the sound collection rolling. As you pick sounds to record, look for “buckets” or “folders” of sounds that are empty, only have a few, or don’t have the type of sound you are looking for.
