[Bob Drake](../07-fabrication/07-08-bob-drake.md) will visit class to demo 8 channel sound devices with stereo panning using custom designed [Tsunami .wav playback devices](https://www.robertsonics.com/tsunami). Bob will also show alternative methods of obtaining "multichannel" effects using individual media players and multichannel interfaces. He will give a short intro to the [Space Control Audio Software](https://github.com/raphaelradna/SpaceControl) that he contributed to. The software is "a multitrack workstation dedicated to the design, realization, and mixture of spatial gestures for electroacoustic music composition". [^1] This will help students develop ideas for designing the sound environment to incorporate multiple zones and areas.

Discussions will focus on how to edit recorded sounds, speaker wiring, and the potential for adding sensors and interactive code to drive the sound.
