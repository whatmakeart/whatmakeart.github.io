## Overview

**Spend 4.5 hours fabricating**

Review your notes from class regarding central pillar ideation, LED placement, pixel mapping, and discussions with Hepp. The group formed a consensus around the general concept of "Big Tree" as well as the "3 Turns." Review the ideation sketches linked here, to refresh you memory about your ideas as well as your peers ideas. Be true to the concept but take risks and experiment as well.

Remember that the elevator is 47" wide, so everything needs to be narrower than that. The plan is to make pieces that slot together to form a greater whole. Make sure to leave space for attachement points as well as steel armature reinforcement.
