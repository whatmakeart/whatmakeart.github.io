## Overview

Time to clean up. Making a large art installation creates a lot of debris in the studio. Before moving forward we will take a moment to clean up.

Now that the installation in installed and the opening reception was a success, it is time to assess the installation and potentially make adjustments and changes. We will assess the installation individually, in small groups, and as an entire class.
