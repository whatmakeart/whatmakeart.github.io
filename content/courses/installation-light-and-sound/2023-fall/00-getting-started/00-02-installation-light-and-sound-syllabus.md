Course Title: Installation: Light + Sound
Sculpture + Expanded Media (SEM) 230A-330A-430A

## Course Description

Sculptural installation is a condition of space that is neither object bound nor object-centric in its existence but rather presents a condition that is often identified as immersive and intentionally organized to produce a spatially dependent experience beyond that of the “Everyday”. This course will investigate various applications and approaches to subject of Installation with an emphasis on contemporary practices using light and sound as a means of constructing space and form. Primary to this course is the understanding of light (lighting) as both a material and structural element with regard to organization and presentation and the combined relationship of sound as an immersive component in the production of installation-based works. Using the gallery as an experimental installation site, this course’s capstone project will culminate in a thematic exhibition project organized with support from the Reinberger Gallery team.
