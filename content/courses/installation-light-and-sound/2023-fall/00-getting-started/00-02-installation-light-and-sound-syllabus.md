Course Title: Installation: Light + Sound
Course Number: SEM 230A-330A-430Aa
Department: Sculpture + Expanded Media (SEM)
Faculty: Jimmy Kuehnle
Semester: Fall 2023

## Course Description

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the sculptural form of space known as the Installation. While this term has a multitude of meanings throughout a wide variety of disciplinary fields, in the area of sculpture, installation refers to a specific condition of space. This condition of space is not necessarily object bound or object-centric in its condition but rather is a condition that is often immersive and intentionally activated to produce an experience beyond that of the everyday. Generally speaking we divide this condition of space into two basic categories known as an "environment" and "site-specific". Within the organizational conditions of this sculptural category of space, beyond the physical boundaries, light and sound are two of the most fundamental elements through which space can be assigned, organized, negotiated, and experientially managed. While technology serves as part of the contemporary source for work employing light and sound, any form or instrumentation/mediation from the digital to the analog to that of the body may serve as a source. These sources include anything from a simple muted light revealed by a burning ember, to an LED light or strobe, to a mediated sound or may even include a live human voice, a human footstep or a simple touch. This course will introduce students to the wide variety of spatial conditions that can be qualified by the existence of light and sound.

### Specific to Fall 2023 Iteration

Using the gallery as an experimental installation site, this course’s capstone project will culminate in a thematic exhibition project organized with support from the Reinberger Gallery team at the Cleveland Institute of Art. Hepp Maccoy of AudioPixel will collaborate with the students in the course to make an immersive light installation. Visiting artists specializing in sound, will assist with the sound components of the installation.

## Description from Course Catalog

Sculptural installation is a condition of space that is neither object bound nor object-centric in its existence but rather presents a condition that is often identified as immersive and intentionally organized to produce a spatially dependent experience beyond that of the “Everyday”. This course will investigate various applications and approaches to subject of Installation with an emphasis on contemporary practices using light and sound as a means of constructing space and form. Primary to this course is the understanding of light (lighting) as both a material and structural element with regard to organization and presentation and the combined relationship of sound as an immersive component in the production of installation-based works.

## Course Overview and Goals

An introduction into the sculptural form known as installation, within the organizational conditions of this sculptural category of space, beyond the physical boundaries, light and sound are two of the most fundamental conditions by which space can be assigned, organized, and experientially managed. Students will investigate space as a medium contextualized by the Installation as a sculptural form using "light and sound" as primary conditions by which aesthetic arrangement purposed as conditions of artistic production are explored.
