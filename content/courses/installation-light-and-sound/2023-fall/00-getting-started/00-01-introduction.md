## Course Overview

This course introduces light and sound as materials for use in creating space in an art installation. This fall 2023 iteration of the course presents students with a special opportunity to create an exhibit for the Cleveland Institute of Art (CIA) Reingberger Gallery. Students start in August to develop their ideas and then fully fabricate and install the final installation for an opening on November 10, 2023. Visiting artists in residence will partner with and guide the students.
