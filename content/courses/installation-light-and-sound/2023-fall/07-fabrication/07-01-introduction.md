Crunch time to fabricate the "Big Tree" and other elements of the installation. As the physical parts start to come together it is time to begin adding LEDs and sound devices to the structures. The LEDs need to be arranged in a sensible way so pixel mapping is possible. Hepp Maccoy will also visit remotely to help with interactive lighting and to give feedback on the project.
