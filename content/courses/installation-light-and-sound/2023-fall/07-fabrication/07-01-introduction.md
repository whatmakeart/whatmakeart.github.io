## Overview

Crunch time to fabricate the "Big Tree" and other elements of the installation. As the physical parts start to come together it is time to begin adding LEDs and sound devices to the structures. The LEDs need to be arranged in a sensible way so pixel mapping is possible. Hepp Maccoy will also visit remotely to help with interactive lighting and to give feedback on the project.

The [exhibition invitation](07-06-installation-exhibition-invitation.md) is designed and ready to go out.

## Learning Objectives

- Solder LED strip lights into custom configurations
- Hook up speakers to amplifiers to play recorded audio
- Learn about the need for power injection on long runs of LEDs to prevent voltage drop
- Explain interactive ideas to a visiting artist in a clear way
