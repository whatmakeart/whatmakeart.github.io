## Overview

**Spend 4.5 hours fabricating**

Make, make, make. Most of your time should be spent working on the installation, but take a few moments to snap some pictures and video of the process. After you are finished working, spend 15 - 20 minutes gathering your visual documentation. Write a description of what you finished, what worked well, what didn't work out, and what are the next steps.
