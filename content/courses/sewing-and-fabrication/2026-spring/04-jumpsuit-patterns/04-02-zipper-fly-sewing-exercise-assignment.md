## Assignment Deliverables

1. Bring sewn zipper fly to class

## Assignment Overview

Use your pants pattern blocks to cutout the front and back pieces of your pants. You do not need to cut out the entire length of the pants, just a fair amount past the front and back J seam. Follow the instructions on how to [How to Sew a Zipper Fly and Waistband](../../../../sewing/how-to-sew-a-zipper-fly-and-waistband.md) as well as [How to Sew Pants](../../../../sewing/how-to-sew-pants.md) to assemble a partial mockup of your pants pattern.

This allows for sewing practice with lower stakes then sewing a final garment and give a chance to check the fit of the copied pattern pieces.
