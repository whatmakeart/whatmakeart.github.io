## Overview

Students build on their foundational sewing skills by learning to draft patterns from existing garments and combine them to create a unique jumpsuit. The focus is on pattern drafting techniques, including duplicating existing garments to create shirt and pants pattern blocks. Students apply techniques like accurate pattern tracing, adding seam allowances, and integrating design elements such as zippers and pockets into their patterns. These skills are essential for creating garments that reflect individual style and creativity.

Students begin working on a custom jumpsuit that merges their shirt and pants patterns, incorporating adjustments for ease and movement, and personalized design elements like flared legs or unique collars. This project encourages creativity in design while reinforcing technical pattern drafting and garment construction skills, helping students gain confidence with more advanced sewing methods. The process includes drafting shirt and pants pattern blocks to create a combined jumpsuit pattern. This module lays the groundwork for future projects, focusing on precision in pattern drafting and the practical application of advanced garment construction techniques and three-dimensional fabric fabrication.
