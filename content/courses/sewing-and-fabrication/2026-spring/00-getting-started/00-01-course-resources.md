## Sewing Material Suppliers

We have most of the needed supplies to get started in the course and complete the technical exercises. Later in the semester based on the content of your projects, you may need materials that are not available in SEM. Some materials are available for purchase on the [CIA Store](https://my.cia.edu/ICS/Departments/CIA_Store/Sculpture__Expanded_Media/). Below are some local and online retailers for sewing supplies, fabric and notions. If you have an idea and are not sure what material to use or if you want to use a material but are not sure how to get it, please ask your faculty.
