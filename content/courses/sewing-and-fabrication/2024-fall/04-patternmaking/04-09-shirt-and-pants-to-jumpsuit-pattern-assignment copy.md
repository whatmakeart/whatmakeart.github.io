## Instructions

Follow the instructions in the video, [starting at 11:15](https://youtu.be/BqeE2gqSrIc&t=675) and the [written instructions]() to trace the pants pattern block onto a new sheet of paper and add seam allowances. Use a clear ruler to add seam allowances as indicated in the instructions and video.Â  You can use a 5/8" seam allowance rather than 1/2" so you have more room for seam finishes.
