## Assignment Deliverables

1. Drafted Shirt Pattern Blocks
2. Drafted Pants Pattern Blocks
3. Drafted Jumpsuit Pattern Block
4. Pattern Pieces with Seam Allowances

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will draft pattern blocks for both a shirt and a pair of pants from your own clothing. After creating accurate pattern blocks, you will combine these blocks to create a custom jumpsuit pattern. The final deliverable will be a completed jumpsuit pattern with seam allowances that can be sewn. This assignment integrates skills in copying existing garment patterns, drafting custom pattern blocks, and adding seam allowances.

## Assignment Instructions

### Copy Shirt and Pants Patterns

1. Use a shirt or T-shirt that fits you well and follow the steps from the [How to Duplicate a T-Shirt Pattern](../../../../sewing/how-to-duplicate-a-t-shirt-pattern.md) video and written instructions. Trace each of the following pattern block pieces onto a new sheet of paper, adding seam allowances for each.

- **Shirt Pattern Block Pieces Needed**:
  - Back Collar
  - Front 1/2 Block
  - Sleeve 1/2 Block
  - Collar Rib Block

2. **Pants Pattern**: Use a pair of well-fitting pants and follow the steps from the [How to Copy a Pants Pattern](../../../../sewing/how-to-duplicate-a-pants-pattern.md) tutorial. Trace each pattern block piece and add seam allowances.

- **Pants Pattern Block Pieces Needed**:
  - Front Block
  - Back Block
  - Fly Facing Block
  - Waistband Block

#### **Step 2: Create the Jumpsuit Pattern Block**

Now that you have individual shirt and pants patterns:

1. **Combine the Shirt and Pants Blocks**: Using your traced patterns, combine the shirt and pants into a single jumpsuit pattern. You will need to adjust the waist seam to ensure a smooth transition from the top (shirt) to the bottom (pants). Add ease where necessary for comfort and movement. Pay special attention to the fit of the waist and length in the torso.

2. **Pattern Block Adjustments**:
   - Ensure the front and back blocks align properly at the waist.
   - Adjust the neckline, armholes, and inseam length to fit your jumpsuit design.
   - Add any desired design elements, such as pockets, zippers, or closures.

#### **Step 3: Add Seam Allowances**

Once your jumpsuit pattern is complete, add seam allowances:

- **Seam Allowances**:
  - Add 1/2" seam allowances to all seams, except for the neckline, which should have a 1/4" seam allowance.
  - Add a 1" allowance for the hem on the pants.
  - Add additional seam allowances for any extra details such as pockets or zippers.

### Additional Guidelines for Customizing Your Jumpsuit Pattern

As you transition from a shirt and pants pattern to a custom jumpsuit, you’ll need to account for specific design features and functional details to ensure your jumpsuit fits well and reflects your personal style. Below are some pointers to help you incorporate these elements effectively:

#### 1. Accounting for a Long Zipper

- **Zipper Length**: Decide if the zipper will go from the collar down to the waist, or extend all the way to the crotch for easy wearability. Make sure the zipper is long enough to accommodate putting on and taking off the jumpsuit comfortably.
- **Zipper Placement**: The zipper is typically placed along the center front of the jumpsuit. Ensure that the zipper lies flat and that the seam allowance accounts for the bulk of the zipper tape. For a more concealed look, consider adding a zipper facing or placket.

- **Adding a Seam Allowance for the Zipper**: Add a 3/8" to 1/2" seam allowance along the center front seam where the zipper will be attached. If you want a clean finish, consider adding an extra 1/4" to 1/2" for a zipper facing or placket.

#### **2. Adding a Collar**

- **Collar Style**: You can choose from various collar types (e.g., a ribbed collar, shirt collar, or mandarin collar). Each style will require different construction methods, so decide based on your desired aesthetic.

- **Drafting the Collar**: To draft the collar, measure the neckline of your jumpsuit pattern (front and back) and draft a collar piece that fits perfectly around it. Ensure the collar seam allowance is consistent with the neckline seam allowance (usually 1/4" to 1/2").

- **Collar Stand**: If your collar has a stand, add an extra piece to the pattern, typically 1" to 1.5" high. A collar stand adds structure and helps the collar sit properly around the neck.

#### 3. Adding Extra Fabric for Movement

- **Ease for Comfort**: Since jumpsuits are a single garment, it’s important to ensure ease and mobility. Add extra width to the torso, sleeves, and legs if needed. For example:
  - **Torso**: Add 2-4 inches of length between the crotch and shoulder for comfort and to prevent the jumpsuit from feeling tight when sitting or bending.
  - **Sleeves**: Add 1/2" to 1" of width to the sleeve pattern for extra arm movement.
  - **Legs**: You may need to adjust the width or shape of the leg for comfort, especially around the hips and thighs.
- **Crotch Ease**: If the jumpsuit is designed for a dropped or relaxed fit, add extra space in the crotch area by lowering the crotch seam.

#### 4. Customizing the Jumpsuit Design

- **Flared Legs**: To create flared legs, widen the leg pattern from the knee down. Use a ruler to angle the side seams outward, creating the desired flare. The more you angle the seams, the wider the flare will be.

- **Spikes, Big Shoulders, or Shoulder Pads**: If you want exaggerated shoulders, you can either add extra width to the shoulder pattern or use shoulder pads. For spikes or dramatic shapes, you can sew stiff interfacing or add additional structural materials inside the garment.

- **Dropped Crotch**: For a relaxed, streetwear-style fit, lower the crotch seam by several inches. This will create a looser, more comfortable fit, particularly around the hips and thighs. Be sure to balance the design by extending the torso.

- **Belt Loops and Waistbands**: If you plan to add a belt to your jumpsuit, include belt loops at evenly spaced intervals (typically 5-7 loops around the waist). To add a waistband, draft a separate waistband piece that will attach at the waist seam. Add seam allowances to both the waistband and the body pieces.

- **Pleats**: Pleats add volume and texture to a garment. To add pleats to your jumpsuit, extend the width of the pattern piece by 2x or 3x the desired pleat depth. Then, fold the pleats into the garment when constructing the jumpsuit. Pleats can be added at the shoulders, waist, or legs for a dramatic effect.

#### **5. Pattern Adjustments for Custom Design Elements**

- **Length Adjustments**: Depending on your desired look, you can lengthen or shorten the torso, sleeves, or legs. When making length adjustments, remember to add extra fabric for hems at the ends of sleeves and pant legs.
- **Seam Allowances for Custom Design Elements**: For every added feature, ensure you include appropriate seam allowances. For example:
  - **For belt loops**: Add 1/8” on each side of the loop width to account for folding.
  - **For pleats**: Double the desired width of the pleat when drafting, and remember to leave extra fabric for tacking the pleats down.

#### **6. General Finishing Details**

- Add 1-2" for hems on the pants and sleeves, depending on your fabric’s thickness.
- Cuffs and sleeve plackets can be added to the ends of sleeves for a more structured look.
- Topstitching along seam lines such as the zipper, waistband, and sleeve cuffs adds durability and a polished appearance.

- **Pocket Placement**: If you want to include pockets in your design (e.g., patch pockets, cargo pockets), be sure to account for the extra fabric needed for pockets and seam allowances.

**Finalize the Jumpsuit Block**:

- **Smooth Seams**: Ensure all seams transition smoothly and are free of sharp angles.
- **Mark Key Points**: Indicate notches, grainlines, and match points on your pattern.
- **Adjust Lengths**: Verify that inseams and outseams match on both front and back pieces.

**Label Pattern Pieces**:

- Clearly label each piece with its name, cut quantity, grainline direction, and any special instructions (e.g., "Cut 2 on fold," "Add interfacing").
