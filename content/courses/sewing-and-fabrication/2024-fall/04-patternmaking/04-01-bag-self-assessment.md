Answer the following Self Assessment questions in the [discussion forum](https://cia.instructure.com/courses/1527/discussion_topics/4526).

1. Overall quality of the sewing and bag construction. Are the seams showing the right sides of the fabric? Is the stitching straight? Is there unwanted puckering of the fabric along seams?
2. Does the design and shape seam intentional? Is it thought out? Is there enough space to put objects?
3. Are the ends of the zipper tape finished with fabric pieces? Does the outside fabric and the lining fabric conceal the long edges of the zipper tape? Is the fabric topstitched into the zipper tape to strengthen the attachment and to prevent fabric snags?
4. Are the pockets orientated in the correct direction? Does the placement of the pockets seam thought out and intentional?
