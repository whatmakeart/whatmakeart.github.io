## Sewing Material Suppliers

We have most of the needed supplies to get started in the course and complete the technical exercises. Later in the semester based on the content of your projects, you may need materials that are not available in SEM. Some materials are available for purchase on the [CIA Store](https://my.cia.edu/ICS/Departments/CIA_Store/Sculpture__Expanded_Media/). Below are some local and online retailers for sewing supplies, fabric and notions. If you have an idea and are not sure what material to use or if you want to use a material but are not sure how to get it, please ask your faculty.

### Fabric

[Upcycle Parts Shop](https://www.upcyclepartsshop.org/) - Local Cleveland business that has all kinds of fabric, sewing supplies and other cool stuff at very low prices. Definitely check them out.

[Jo-Ann’s Fabrics](https://www.joann.com/) - 1533 Golden Gate Plaza #153 – (440) 684-1567 - Generally more expensive than many online retailers but has many items in stock. Also has fabric available on sale that can be good deals if you go hunting.

Thrift Stores such as Goodwill, Salvation Army, the Cache are good places to get unique materials for projects.

The online retailers below also have a wide selection of fabric but you must plan ahead due to shipping times.
