Students build on their foundational sewing skills by learning to construct a variety of pockets, a key element in garment and bag design. Moving beyond basic seams, the focus this week is on creating patch pockets, cargo pockets, double welt pockets, and zipper pockets. Through hands-on instruction, students will learn to apply techniques like using fusible interfacing, working with zippers, and finishing raw edges with French seams or serging. These skills are essential for creating clean, professional-looking pockets that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

The week also emphasizes applying these techniques in a design project. Students will begin working on a custom bag that incorporates at least two pockets, a zipper closure, and a lining to conceal raw edges. This project encourages creativity in design while reinforcing technical sewing skills, helping students gain confidence with more advanced construction methods. Assignments for the week include a pocket bag project and a pocket sewing exercise, both of which will be graded based on craftsmanship, design, and execution. This module lays the groundwork for future projects, focusing on precision and the practical application of sewing techniques.
