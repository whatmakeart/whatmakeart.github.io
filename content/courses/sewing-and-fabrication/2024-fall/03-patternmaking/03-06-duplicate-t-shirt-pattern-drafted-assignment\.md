Follow the instructions in the video, [starting at 6:54](https://youtu.be/quZHvzsZHwc&t=414) and the [written instructions](./03-03-how-to-duplicate-t-shirt-pattern.md) to trace the T-Shirt pattern block onto a new sheet of paper and add seam allowances. Use a clear ruler to add seam allowances as indicated in the instructions and video. You can use a 5/8" seam allowance rather than 1/2" so you have more room for seam finishes.
