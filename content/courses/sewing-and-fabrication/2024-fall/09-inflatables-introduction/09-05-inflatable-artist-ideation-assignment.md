## Overview

After reviewing, researching, and gathering inspiration from [inflatable artists](./09-01-inflatable-artists.md) develop ideation sketches for potential sewn pneumatic structures, sculptures, or wearables. Sketching, sketching, sketching â€“ whether analog or digital you should begin with sketching.

## Process

Sketches can be made with analog techniques, digital techniques, or a combination of both. You can use pencils, markers, paper photo collage, digital photo collage, 3D modeling, vector graphics, digital painting and any other means of ideation and iteration.

### Variety and Depth

It is important that you generate many different ideas and concepts that are unique inflatable designs. It is also important that you iterate on these different concepts to develop them past their initial idea phase. Variety, lots of different ideas, and iteration, variations of an idea, are important skills for the ideation process. Avoid the trap of instantly settling on a single idea. Push yourself to make new and unknown ideas. This is how you will grow as a creative.

### Ideation Documentation

Scan or photograph your sketches. Images should be square to the frame and not crooked. No shadows or other poor lighting situations. Especially avoid shadows cast from a camera. Correct the images for exposure, levels, and white balance. Straighten and crop the images as necessary so nothing but the paper and sketches show in the images. Combine the images as a PDF or upload as jpgs.

Upload your ideation sketches and object form studies to Canvas.
