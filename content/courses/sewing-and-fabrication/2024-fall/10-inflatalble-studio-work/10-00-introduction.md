## Overview

Students present inflatable artist research and inspiration. The class presents and discusses inflatable ideation sketches and work proposals. The inflatable sewing exercises from the previous class are combined into a functional inflatable. Students can study how expectations of form and shape of an inflatable may or may not be true once inflated.

## Learning Objectives

- Explore new techniques and methods for realizing creative ideas
- Problem solve while moving from ideation to prototype to full-scale form
- Gain experience working in larger scales and contexts
- Explore physical forces, pressure, tension and their possibilities and restrictions
