## Technical Tips

### Circles into the Ends of Tubes

Sometimes you need to calculate the amount of fabric needed to “cap” the end of a fabric tube with a fabric circle. These links have instructions on how to calculate the seam allowances and draw the patterns.
Remember:

- The circumference of a circle: C = 2 π r
- The area of a circle: A = π r2

### Tube Miter Template Links

Often you will work with tubing intersecting other tubing. With the soft fabric is not necessary to have precise miters as when working with metal but here is that have tubing miter calculators for your reference. You can print out the templates and then enlarge them by hand on butcher paper to the size that you need.

### Working with Large Sheets of Material

When laying out large sheets of material g, space becomes an issue. Working on the floor can be unavoidable but anytime you can work in a more comfortable position it is best to do so. One technique is to pin the material to a wall in the classroom. You can then use your ruler and Sharpie to draw out the needed pieces for your inflatable without needing to walk on the material. This also keep the material cleaner.

### Transporting & Storing Your Project

A trash bag or duffle bag is a great way to store and transport inflatables. Make sure that you label any bag with large, clear type. A bag of plastic may be mistaken for trash and accidentally thrown away.
