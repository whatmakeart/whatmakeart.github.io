## Overview

Fabric fabrication involves transforming flat planer materials such as fabric or plastic into three-dimensional forms based on how different shape polygon forms are assembled

Concave and convex shapes will give different results and forms. Special attention must be played to seam allowances on the insides and outsides of curves. This is especially true when installing cylindrical objects into circular recesses.

Students practice making common forms out of fabric and preparation for designing and fabricating more intentional and unique fabric objects.
