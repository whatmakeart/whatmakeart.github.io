## Overview

Students evaluate and assess in progress digital fabrication projects.

Testing out design concepts in physical reality is an important part of the design process. By examining digitally fabricated parts in physical space versus solely in the digital world of 3D modeling, students can assess they're in progress lamp designs and make adjustments based on empirical evidence. Sometimes this requires a complete restart of the design and other times it may require minor tweaks. The design process is cyclical and is based on assessment of real evidence and then modifications and changes based on that evidence and experience and intuition.
