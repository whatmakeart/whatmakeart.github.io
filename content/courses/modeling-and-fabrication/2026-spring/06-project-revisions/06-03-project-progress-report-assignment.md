## Assignment Deliverables

1. Brief written summary of current status of project
   - Label files YYYY-MM-DD Last Name First Name Project Progress Report (`.pdf`, `.docx`)
2. Photo and/or video documentation of project progress
   - Label files YYYY-MM-DD Last Name First Name Project Progress Documentation (`.png`,`.jpg`)

## Assignment Overview

Progress reports are an opportunity for critical reflection during initial prototyping and subsequent revisions on the way to the final output.

A strong progress report documents your current state,so someone else can understand your project in 60 seconds, and allows you to plan your next steps with realistic actions and deadlines, so you finish on time. Think of this as a short production memo for your future self. Remember, smart people write things down.

This checkpoint is a mini design review. Your goal is to compile clear evidence of what you have completed so far, what changed since your earlier sketches/model, what is working, what is not, and what you will do next. The objective is to evaluate the success of the how the additive 3D printed components are currently interfacing with the subtractive laser-cut planar forms.

### Assignment Requirements

#### Written Summary

Write a summary of what has occurred so far in the project. This is informal but specific. Do not worry about how the information sounds or how it is written. The point is clear communication about the reality of the project and what you have done since last class. If everything did not work, then write that in your report and document it.

Possible prompts for your summary:

- What is finished?
- What needs to be completed?
- Evaluate what parts are worth keeping and what parts are no longer important.
- Provide an estimated time breakdown for the remaining production.
- What did you remove because it was unnecessary or unrealistic?
- What new component became important after prototyping?
- What surprised you when you tested the physical pieces?

#### Visual Documentation

Include 2-4 photos or a short video showing the current physical state of the lamp with at least one close-up of a specific section such as a joint between a 3D printed part and a laser-cut part.
