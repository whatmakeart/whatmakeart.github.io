Now that you have laser cut out at least one part and 3D printed at least one part, there are probably many things that you would want to do differently if you started your project from scratch. The design process is an iterative process full of successes and setbacks. When we realize something that we should have done in a design it is not a failure, rather it is a success because we have learned something about the design process and our project.

Reflect on your design process including the ideation process, the digital modeling process in Fusion, the physical output laser cutting, the 3D printing process, and the assembly fit process.

Ask the questions below to your partner about their project. Take notes and record their answers as a reply to this discussion thread. Your reply will be what you understood about your peer's answers about their laser cut and 3D printed parts.

## Questions

1. 5. Now that you some physical pieces of your formally digital only model, what do you think? Did everything turn out exactly how you expected? What was different?
   - Too small?
   - Too big?
   - Wrong shape?
   - Who knows?
2. How did laser cutting go? What issues did you run into? What would you do differently?
3. How did 3D printing go? What issues did you run into? What would you do differently?
4. What would you change about how you designed your 3D model in Fusion, Blender, Maya?
   - Would you now take a different approach?
   - Why and how?
5. Is your design missing any of the assignment requirements?
   - Which one(s)?
   - How to you plan to include all the requirements?
6. What challenges did you face and how did you attempt to overcome them?
7. What is the next physical action needed to make progress on your project?
