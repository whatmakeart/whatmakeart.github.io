## Overview

This module introduces laser cutting as a digital fabrication process. Laser cutting can cut all the way through a material or etch on its surface. Laser cutting is a quick way to rapidly prototype and test ideas and concepts. It can make parts with high accuracy and repeatability. It is limited to creating flat pieces of relatively thin thickness. Combining laser cutting with 3D printing expands the forms possible by leveraging the different strengths of each process.

Students continue the design and fabrication process based on ideation sketches and physical cardboard prototypes. After discussing ideation sketches and cardboard models with the group, students will make necessary modifications to their designs. Then the class will study how use Fusion to convert a sketch and a cardboard model into a digital 3D model designed for fabrication with a laser cutter and 3D printer. We will examine how to keep the parts as separate components. This project introduces custom [user parameters in Fusion](https://youtu.be/H6W-Og4YyZ8). These are like variables for dimensions that we can change and have the model update automatically. The use of user defined parameters is essential for [parametric modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/parametric-modeling.md).

## Learning Objectives

- Use sketch projections in Fusion
- Design a modular 3D model in Fusion for laser cutting
- Use separate components for separate parts of the project
- Export rendered images of 3D Model
- Use Adobe Illustrator to make laser cut file for test cut
- Use Epilog laser cutting software to cut and etch wood and plastic
- Create iterative designs and ideation sketches
- Refine designs for assembly and fabrication
