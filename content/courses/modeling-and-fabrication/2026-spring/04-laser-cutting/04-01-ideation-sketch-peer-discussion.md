Reply to the discussion thread with a written self assessment of your ideation sketches and cardboard model of your lamp concept. You do not need to answer the questions below but they may be helpful to guide your self assessment and evaluation of your ideation process.

1. Look at your 3 refined sketches. How did you decide which specific parts of the lamp should be additive, 3D printed, and which should be subtractive or planar, laser cut? Why is the 3D printer or the laser cutter the best choice for those specific components?

2. Describe the physical connection point between your 3D printed part and your laser-cut material. How does this joint solve the puzzle of joining two different materials?

3. Looking at your 1:1 cardboard model, what is the most significant thing you learned about the physical size or 3D form of your lamp that you didn't realize when drawing the thumbnails?

4. How are you using the laser-cut material for its strengths (speed, structural rigidity, or diffusion) rather than just treating it like "flat plastic"?
5. How you have integrated the E26 lamp socket mounting and the required laser engraving. Are these decorative additions, or are they essential to the function of the lamp?

6. Compare your initial thumbnails to your final cardboard model. What is one constraint or design challenge you discovered during the ideation phase that forced you to change your original idea?
