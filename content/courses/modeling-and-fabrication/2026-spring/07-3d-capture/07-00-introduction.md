## Overview

This module introduces students to the bridge between the physical and digital worlds through 3D Capture technologies. Using photogrammetry and structured light scanning, you will learn to digitize complex physical objects and translate them into functional 3D assets for further design and fabrication.

Beyond simple capture, this module focuses on the technical workflow of cleaning scanned data to turn dense, irregular meshes into organized, usable geometry. You will explore the power of T-Splines in Autodesk Fusion to model organic forms around these scans, allowing for integration of hand-made or found objects with precision-engineered components.

## Learning Objectives

- Successfully generate 3D models from the physical world using both Photogrammetry and Structured Light Scanning.
- Export and organize the three core components of a digital scan, the OBJ mesh geometry, PNG texture map, and MTL material information.
- Use Blender to perform Voxel Remeshing to convert irregular scan data into clean quad-based geometry more suitable for CAD environments.
- Import 3D scan meshes into Fusion as reference geometry for modeling organic forms.
- Use of T-Splines to create smooth, complex surfaces that would be difficult to achieve through traditional parametric modeling.
