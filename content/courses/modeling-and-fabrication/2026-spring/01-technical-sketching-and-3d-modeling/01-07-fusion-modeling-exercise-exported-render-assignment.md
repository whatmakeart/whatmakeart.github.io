## Assignment Deliverables

1. Upload a minimum of 1 render image of the Fusion 360 Modeling Exercise
   - Label your exported render image: YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname 3D Modeling Exercise Render.png

## Assignment Instructions

1. Watch the [Fusion 3D Modeling Exercise](https://youtu.be/arTAFuBS-qI) video. This walks you through modeling your first part in Fusion. It introduces sketches, sketch constraints, appearances as well as rendering. Follow along and make the part from the example. You can use the sketch of the part below for reference.
2. Add a material to the object other than the default grey steel. Press "a" on your keyboard to bring up the appearance browser. Select the material of your choice. It doesn't have to be wood and it doesn't have to be the same material on each face. Experiment and see what happens.
3. Export a render of your part as a PNG. You can render on your machine or in the cloud. Double check that the object is not super tiny in the render preview.
4. In the render settings make sure one of the dimensions is set to 4000px so you have enough resolution and choose a 1:1, 3:4, or 16:9 aspect ratio.
5. Label the render image file and upload it. YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname 3D Modeling Exercise Render.png

## Practice Modeling

Once you finish this exercise, try to model a creation of your own. Don't worry about making mistakes, just experiment. Add materials, make some renders, and upload them with your assignment. We will talk more about modeling techniques next week and throughout the semester.
