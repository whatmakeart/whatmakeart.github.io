## Overview

This module covers [technical sketching](01-02-technical-sketching.md) and an introduction to [3D modeling](01-01-3d-modeling.md). First we strip away complex software to focus on pure spatial reasoning. Students will learn the universal language of engineering, orthographic projection and basic drafting techniques, enabling them to communicate complex 3D forms instantly with a pencil and paper. In order to understand digital 3D modeling tools it is important to have a basic foundational understanding and proficiency in technical sketching. This will form the foundation for the "why" and "how" of the digital 3D modeling tools.

We will use multiple [3D modeling software](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-modeling-software.md) packages in this course but will begin with [Autodesk Fusion](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/fusion-360.md) that has [parametric modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/parametric-modeling.md) tools and the ability to create toolpaths used for fabricating and producing physical objects from digital 3D models. Fusion uses digital sketches, sketch constraints, and techniques borrowed from the traditional world of pen and pencil technical drawing.

## Learning Outcomes

- Demonstrate motor control by drawing consistent, straight lines without a ruler.
- Practice technical drawing and sketching techniques
- Draw isometric cubes and circles with triangles and a compass
- Differentiate between artistic drawing and technical communication
- Sketch objects using [third angle projections](01-04-third-angle-projections.md)
- 3D model a basic object in Fusion 360
- Create a rendered image of a 3D modeled object in Autodesk Fusion
