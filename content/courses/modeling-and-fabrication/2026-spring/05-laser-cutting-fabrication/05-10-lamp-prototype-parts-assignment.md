## Assignment Deliverables

1. Upload an updated and revised 3D Model file of your lamp project
   - Label file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Updated 3D Model (`.f3d`, `.blend`, `.ma`)
2. Upload an updated render image of your revised 3D model
   - Label file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Updated Render Image (`.png`, `.jpg`)
3. Laser cut a minimum of 1 piece or a part of a piece of your project
   - Bring physical laser cut part to class
4. 3D Print a minimum of 1 piece or part of a piece of your project
   - Bring physical 3D printed Part to class

## Assignment Overview

Review your self assessment comments from class. Use this as a guide to make revisions to your digital 3D model file.

Make changes to your digital 3D model to improve the design of your 3D printed and laser cut lamp project. In Autodesk Fusion it is best to go back in the design timeline to make changes to design features. Sometimes it is easier to edit from the end of the design timeline. The goal is to have a better 3D model than what you started with.

The laser cut part and 3D printed part may be full of mistakes or may not work at all. That is ok. This is the prototype part of the design phase. Of course you should strive for parts that work but do not limit your experimentation. There is no penalty for something not working. The only incorrect way to experiment and prototype is to do nothing.

### Materials

#### 3D Printing Materials

3D printing filament is in the Fab Studios labeled for this course. There is additional filament on the cart in 203.

- Email your instructor if the filament needs to be restocked.

#### Laser Cutting Materials

Plywood and acrylic sheets are on the cart in room 203. Use the plywood and acrylic sheets efficiently.

- Do not put your cut piece in the middle since that wastes material.
- Use the smallest piece that will fit your part.
- Start from the edges and pack in parts as tight as you can to fit multiple parts per sheet.
- Email your instructor if the size and thickness of the material you need is not available on the cart

### Time Management Guidelines

How your spend your time on the assignment is up to you but the recommendations below can help you efficiently use your time.

- ~ 2 hours revising and updating your digital 3D model file
- ~ 1 hour for for laser cutting
  - Laying parts flat
  - Exporting DXF
  - Cutting part in Fab Studios
- ~ 1 hour for 3D Printing
  - Export STL or 3mf file
  - 3D Print at Fab Studios or Foundation 3D printers
- ~ 30 minutes for render image and upload
  - Set aspect ratio
  - Setup render image composition
  - Render image
  - Export 3D Model file
  - Label and upload render image and 3D model file

### 3D Modeling and Design Points to Consider

- Do you have connection joints that interlock so the laser cut pieces are easy to align?
- Do you have "feet" on the bottom corners of the design that rest on surfaces to add stability?
- Are all the `ply` dimensions correct? Did you use `ply` for every dimension referring to the plywood or acrylic sheet thickness?
- Are negative space cutouts used to enhance the design?
- Do you have enough support pieces and braces for strength?
- Where can the design be made more interesting and appealing?
- Are there places to add geometric or organic contours, rather than just rectangles?
- Is each piece an individual component?
- How does the fastener work?

### Render Image Reminders

After you make changes to your design, make sure that materials are applied to all the parts. Make a new render image of the updated model. Use a 1:1, 2:3, 4:6, 16:9 aspect ratio, not the viewport ratio. Set the longer dimension of the render to 4000px. Make sure to have a good composition and to have the rendered object large in the frame.

## Project Prototype Physical Output

You are only required to have a minimum of 1 laser cut piece from your Fusion project file and a minimum of one 3D printed piece from your Fusion project file, but it makes sense to laser cut all the pieces and to 3D print all the pieces os you an test the fit and size of your design. You can use Blender or other 3D software to create your 3D model.

### Laser Cutting

#### Fab Studios Laser Cutting

Bring your exported DXF file to the Fab Studios to use the laser cutter.

#### think\[box\] Laser Cutting

Bring your exported DXF file to the think\[box\] to use the laser cutter.

If something doesn't work out right, modify your model and try to cut it out again. If you need additional plywood, plywood of a different thickness, or acrylic sheet then contact your instructor.

#### Using Acrylic

The laser cutters can cut acrylic plastic. Make sure you leave the protective paper on the acrylic so it can be identified. Polycarbonate is not able to be cut so you must be able to read the protective paper to determine the material. Acrylic cuts cleanly on the laser cutter without the burn marks of wood.

### 3D Printing

Use the 3D printers in Fab Studios, in Foundation Studios,or at the think\[box\] to print the 3D printed parts of your project. Print as soon as you can since the 3D printing takes more time then laser cutting.
