Use the prompts below to guide your self assessment of your lamp 3D model. Reply to this discussion thread. You can also answer different prompts related to the assessment of your 3D model and render image. You can answer any prompts that feel most relevant to your design.

1. Is every part modeled as its own separate component? Are components clearly named?
2. Did you create and use a user parameter `ply` to drive material thickness? If you chang the value of `ply`, do the pieces update correctly?
3. What laser joint(s) are you using? Do they look possible?
4. Where is your threaded connection?
5. What is the intentional connection between the 3D printed part(s) and the laser-cut part(s)?
6. What surface(s) are reserved for laser etching and engraving?
7. Are there sharp corners, edges, pinch points, or thin fragile features? Where could you add fillets, chamfers, or negative 8. pace to improve readability and strength?
8. What’s one change you could make to push the design further such as more organic forms, a stronger silhouette, better proportions, or more intentional repetition?
9. Does your render show the lamp clearly with a good camera angle, lighting, and materials? Did you include a simple environment or scale cue so it doesn’t feel like it’s floating?
