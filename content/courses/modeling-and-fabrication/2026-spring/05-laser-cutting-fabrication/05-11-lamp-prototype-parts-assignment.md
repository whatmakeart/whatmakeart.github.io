## Assignment Deliverables

1. Upload an updated and revised 3D Model file of your lamp project
   - Label file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Updated 3D Model (`.f3d`, `.blend`, `.ma`)
2. Upload an updated render image of 3D model with design changes
   - Label file YYYY-MM-DD Lastname Firstname Updated Render image (`.png`, `.jpg`)
3. Laser cut a minimum of 1 piece or a part of a piece of your project
4. 3D Print a minimum of 1 piece or part of a piece of your project

## Assignment Overview

Make changes to your Fusion 3D model to improve the design of your 3D printed clamp and laser cut project. Sometimes it is best to go back in the timeline to make changes, other times it is easier to edit from the end of the timeline. The goal is to have a better 3D model than what you started with.

### Points to consider?

- Do you have connection joints that interlock so the laser cut pieces are easy to align?
- Do you have "feet" on the bottom corners of the design that rest on surfaces to add stability?
- Are all the `ply` dimensions correct? Did you use `ply` for every dimension referring to the plywood or acrylic sheet thickness?
- Are negative space cutouts used to enhance the design?
- Do you have enough support pieces and braces for strength?
- Where can the design be made more interesting and appealing?
- Are there places to add geometric or organic contours, rather than just rectangles?
- Is each piece an individual component?
- How does the fastener work? Did you make a slot for a captive nut?
- Do the 3D Printed threads have enough clearance created with offset faces?

## Make Updated Renders of Your Project

After you make changes to your design, make sure that materials are applied to all the parts. Make a new render image of the updated model. Use a 1:1, 2:3, 4:6, 16:9 aspect ratio, not the viewport ratio.Set the longer dimension of the render to 4000px. Make sure to have a good composition and to have the rendered object large in the frame.

## Cut out your Project

You are only required to have a minimum of 1 laser cut piece from your Fusion 360 project file and a minimum of 3D printed piece from your Fusion 360 project file, but it makes sense to laser cut all the pieces and to 3D print all the pieces os you an test the fit and size of your design.

### Laser Cutting

#### Fab Studios Laser Cutting

Bring your exported DXF file to the Fab Studios to use the laser cutter.

#### think\[box\] Laser Cutting

Bring your exported DXF file to the think\[box\] to use the laser cutter.

If something doesn't work out right, modify your model and try to cut it out again. If you need additional plywood, plywood of a different thickness, or acrylic sheet then contact your instructor.

### 3D Printing

Use the 3D printers in Fab Studios, in Foundation Studios,or at the think\[box\] to print the 3D printed parts of your project. Print as soon as you can since the 3D printing takes more time then laser cutting.

## Using Acrylic

The laser cutters can cut acrylic plastic. Make sure you leave the protective paper on the acrylic so it can be identified. Polycarbonate is not able to be cut so you must be able to read the protective paper to determine the material. Acrylic cuts cleanly on the laser cutter without the burn marks of wood.
