## Overview

This module covers how to use the information from [technical sketches](../../../../drawing/technical-sketching.md) to create 3D Models in [Autodesk Fusion](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/fusion-360.md). It shows how to use Fusion to 3D model objects from sketches and how to use sketch constraints. You will learn about Rule #1 and some best practices in parametric 3D modeling as you continue to explore and learn Fusion. You will also export renders of your 3D models with realistic materials applied.

## Learning Outcomes

- Use third angle projection drawings to make 3D Digital Models of everyday objects
- Use Fusion sketch constraints
- 3D model a basic object in Fusion
- Organize 3D model with components and bodies
- Apply materials to 3D Models in Fusion
- Export rendered images of 3D Models with HDRI backgrounds at specific resolutions and aspect ratios
