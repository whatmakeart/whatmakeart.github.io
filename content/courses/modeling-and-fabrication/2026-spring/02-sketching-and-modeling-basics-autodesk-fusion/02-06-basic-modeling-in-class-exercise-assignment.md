## Assignment Deliverables

1.  Create a single object or objects that use all of the primary creation, modification, and pattern tools in Autodesk Fusion.
    - Show the Design Timeline at the bottom of the screen that includes at least one of each of the following features.

## Assignment Overview

Start by building the core structure of your object. You can perform these steps in any order, but all features must be present in the design timeline in Fusion.

- **Revolve:** Create a profile sketch and revolve it around an axis to create a base or a central pillar.
- **Extrude:** Sketch a shape on a plane or a face and extrude it to add volume, subtract volume, or intersect volume.
- **Sweep:** Draw a path (using a spline or lines) and a profile (like a circle) on a perpendicular plane to "sweep" a tube-like form along that path.
- **Loft:** Create two separate sketches on parallel or offset planes and use the Loft tool to transition the shape between them.

Add specific structural features and details to your form.

- **Hole:** Use the Hole command, rather than an extruded circle to place a counterbore or countersink hole on a flat face.
- **Rib:** Create a single line sketch and use the Rib tool to create a thin support wall perpendicular to a face.
- **Web:** Create a sketch of intersecting lines and use the Web tool to create a grid of supports within a hollow area.
- **Emboss:** Create a text sketch or a simple shape on a plane tangent to a curved surface, then use Emboss to wrap that sketch onto the face.

Take one or more of the of the features you just created and multiply it across the model.

- **Mirror:** Mirror a feature across an origin plane.
- **Rectangular Pattern:** Take a feature and repeat it along two linear axes.
- **Circular Pattern:** Repeat a feature around a center axis or a circular edge.
- **Pattern on Path:** Create a unique path and repeat a feature along that specific line.

Finish the object by refining the edges and internal volume.

- **Split Body:** Use a construction plane or a sketch to slice your model into two distinct pieces.
- **Shell:** Select a face to hollow out your solid, giving it a specific wall thickness.
- **Fillet:** Select sharp edges to round them over.
- **Chamfer:** Select edges to create a 45-degree bevel.
