## Assignment Deliverables

1.  Create a single object or objects that use all of the primary creation, modification, and pattern tools in Autodesk Fusion. Spend time in class using the modeling tools and asking questions. You do not turn anything in for this in class exercise.

## Assignment Overview

- [Fusion Basic Creation Tools](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/basic-creation-tools-fusion-360.md)
- [Fusion Basic Pattern Tools](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/basic-pattern-tools-fusion-360.md)

Start by building the core structure of your object. You can perform these steps in any order, but all features should be present in the design timeline in Fusion. You don’t have to model anything specific, the point is to successfully use each tool once

- **Extrude:** Sketch a shape on a plane or a face and extrude it to add volume, subtract volume, or intersect volume. [Extrude Demo Video](https://youtu.be/W-TGqdbtylA)
- **Revolve:** Create a profile sketch and revolve it around an axis to create a base or a central pillar. [Revolve Demo Video](https://youtu.be/VzossdZbGtk)
- **Sweep:** Draw a path (using a spline or lines) and a profile (like a circle) on a perpendicular plane to "sweep" a tube-like form along that path. [Sweep Demo Video](https://youtu.be/CAwihMKEhF4)
- **Loft:** Create two separate sketches on parallel or offset planes and use the Loft tool to transition the shape between them. [Loft Demo Video](https://youtu.be/BV5S98H6ruQ)

Add specific structural features and details to your form.

- **Hole:** Use the Hole command, rather than an extruded circle to place a counterbore or countersink hole on a flat face.
- **Rib:** Create a single line sketch and use the Rib tool to create a thin support wall perpendicular to a face. [Rib Demo Video](https://youtu.be/tSJMjs9rDJA)
- **Web:** Create a sketch of intersecting lines and use the Web tool to create a grid of supports within a hollow area. [Web Demo Video](https://youtu.be/acUZkwFgr5s)
- **Emboss:** Create a text sketch or a simple shape on a plane tangent to a curved surface, then use Emboss to wrap that sketch onto the face. [Emboss Demo Video](https://youtu.be/6UH6YApDj3U)

Take one or more of the of the features you just created and multiply it across the model.

- **Mirror:** Mirror a feature across an origin plane. [Mirror Demo Video](https://youtu.be/vwCUjtsghdI)
- **Rectangular Pattern:** Take a feature and repeat it along two linear axes. [Rectangular Pattern Video Demo](https://youtu.be/Y0nYNZvL0EA)
- **Circular Pattern:** Repeat a feature around a center axis or a circular edge. [Circular Pattern Video Demo](https://youtu.be/As3TVfDPu4g)
- **Pattern on Path:** Create a unique path and repeat a feature along that specific line. [Cut out shapes in a pattern along a path](https://youtu.be/do4VSfm782Y)

Finish the object by refining the edges and internal volume.

- **Split Body:** Use a construction plane or a sketch to slice your model into two distinct pieces.
- **Shell:** Select a face to hollow out your solid, giving it a specific wall thickness.
- **Fillet:** Select sharp edges to round them over.
- **Chamfer:** Select edges to create a 45-degree bevel.
