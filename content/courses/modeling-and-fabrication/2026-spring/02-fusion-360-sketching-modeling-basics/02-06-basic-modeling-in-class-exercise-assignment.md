This in-class exercise, is designed to prioritize process over product. The goal is to build a complex, abstract sculpture that serves as a "checklist" of Fusion’s core tools. By the end of the session, every student's design timeline should serve as a visual receipt of their technical proficiency.

## Exercise: The Feature Totem

**Objective:** Create a single "sculpture" or component that utilizes all primary creation, modification, and pattern tools in Autodesk Fusion.

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Creation Tools)

Start by building the core structure of your object. You must perform these steps in any order, but they must all be present.

- **Revolve:** Create a profile sketch and revolve it around an axis to create a base or a central pillar.
- **Extrude:** Sketch a shape on a plane or a face and extrude it to add or subtract volume.
- **Sweep:** Draw a path (using a spline or lines) and a profile (like a circle) on a perpendicular plane to "sweep" a tube-like form along that path.
- **Loft:** Create two separate sketches on parallel or offset planes (e.g., a circle and a square) and use the Loft tool to transition the shape between them.
- **Emboss:** Create a text sketch or a simple shape on a plane tangent to a curved surface, then use Emboss to wrap that sketch onto the face.

### Phase 2: Structural Details (Engineering Tools)

Now, add specific structural features to your form to demonstrate control over geometry.

- **Hole:** Use the Hole command (rather than an extruded circle) to place a counterbore or countersink hole on a flat face.
- **Rib:** Create a single line sketch and use the Rib tool to create a thin support wall perpendicular to a face.
- **Web:** Create a sketch of intersecting lines and use the Web tool to create a "grid" of supports within a hollow area.

### Phase 3: Multiplication & Symmetry (Pattern Tools)

Take one of the features you just created and multiply it across the model.

- **Mirror:** Mirror a feature (like your Hole or Extrude) across an origin plane.
- **Rectangular Pattern:** Take a feature and repeat it along two linear axes (a grid).
- **Circular Pattern:** Repeat a feature around a center axis or a circular edge.
- **Pattern on Path:** Create a unique path (like a curve on the surface) and repeat a feature along that specific line.

### Phase 4: Refinement & Manipulation (Modify Tools)

Finish the object by refining the edges and internal volume.

- **Split Body:** Use a construction plane or a sketch to slice your model into two distinct pieces.
- **Shell:** Select a face to "hollow out" your solid, giving it a specific wall thickness.
- **Fillet:** Select sharp edges to round them over.
- **Chamfer:** Select edges to create a 45-degree (or angled) bevel.
