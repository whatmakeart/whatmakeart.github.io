[3D Modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md) can transform your two-dimensional ideas into three-dimensional forms.

The foundation of most parametric and "CAD" [3D modeling software](../../../../3d-modeling/3d-modeling-software.md) is the 2D Sketch to 3D Solid workflow. Instead of directly modeling solids or meshes, this workflow is parametric, meaning you define shapes using dimensions and relationships. The benefit is that if you change a measurement in your initial sketch, the entire 3D model updates automatically to match.

The transition from a flat idea to a physical-looking object follows a simple, repeatable cycle:

### 1. Create a Sketch (2D)

Every 3D object starts on a 2D plane (like a piece of paper). You choose a "work plane"—front, side, or top—and use tools like lines, circles, and rectangles to draw the profile of your object.

### 2. Apply Constraints and Dimensions

To make your sketch "smart," you apply **constraints** (rules like "these two lines must be equal") and **dimensions** (specific measurements). This ensures your design stays predictable as it gets more complex.

### 3. Create a Feature (3D)

Once your 2D profile is finished, you use a **Create** tool to add volume. The most common tool is the **Extrude**, which pushes your flat sketch into the third dimension, turning a circle into a cylinder or a square into a cube.

### 4. Refine and Modify

After you have a basic 3D "solid," you can refine it using **Modify** tools. You might add **Fillets** to round off sharp edges or **Shell** a block to make it a hollow container.

## Why This Matters

Mastering this workflow allows you to design with intent. Whether you are creating a character, a piece of jewelry, or a sculptural installation, the Sketch-to-Solid method gives you the technical control to iterate quickly and prepare your files for 3D printing or CNC milling.
