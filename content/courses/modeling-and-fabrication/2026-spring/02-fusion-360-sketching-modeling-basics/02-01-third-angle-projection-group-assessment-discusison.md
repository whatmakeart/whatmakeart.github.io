1. Could someone else correctly identify the Front / Top / Right on the page without being told? What specific cues such ast labels, alignment, or projection layout made it obvious or confusing?

2. If you had to model this in Fusion 360 _without seeing the object_, which view would you start from? Does the drawing clearly support that choice?

3. List 3 dimensions, details, or notes that are missing or unclear in the drawing that would prevent accurate modeling. For example a missing hole diameter, hole depth, radius of fillets, wall thickness, chamfers, angles, or symmetry. What’s the minimum additional information you’d need to add to proceed with modeling the object?

4. Are the dimensions placed so they’re readable, not crossing objects, and with clear extension lines? Are units clearly stated as mm and are dimensions consistent with no conflicting numbers?

5. Identify one feature that two different people might interpret differently. What simple change would remove that ambiguity?

6. Does the digital image meet usable documentation quality? Does it have flat lighting? Are there heavy shadows? Is the image in focus? Is it straightened and cropped? Is it high enough resolution? What one improvement would most increase the digital image clarity?
