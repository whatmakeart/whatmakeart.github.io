The Design Process is cyclical. After an initial idea or concept is formed, it is iterated upon and improved. Eventually a fabricated prototype is tested to see if previous assumptions are correct. Based on assessment and evaluation of a prototype, change recommendations are made. Parts of the design that work well are also noted. Then changes are made and the process repeats.
