## Overview

Before working on a final version of a project it is important to understand the
process. To better understand FFF 3D printing, we will make small test prints.
This will familiarize you with how to export an STL file, how to use slicing
software to prepare your file, how to load filament into the printer, what can
go wrong with overhangs and supports, and other intangibles that are only
learnable through experience. We will keep the 3D print test prints small so
when inevitable problems occur not a lot of time or material is wasted. It is a
good idea to make multiple test prints, making changes to your model based on
how the print turns out.

## Learning Objectives

- Slice STL file in Cura
- Add supports and raft as needed to print
- Load PLA filament onto 3D Printer
