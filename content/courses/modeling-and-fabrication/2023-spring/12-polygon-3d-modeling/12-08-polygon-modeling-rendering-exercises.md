## Assignment Deliverables

1. Render image of an object modeled in Blender or Maya (png, jpg)
   - Minimum 1920 x 1080 pixel render image
   - Minimum of 2 lights (can have more lights)
   - Minimum of 2 objects, model and background (can have many more objects)
   - Apply materials and/or shaders to objects and background
   - Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Polygon Modeling Render Image

## Assignment Overview

Rendering in Blender and Maya take a bit more setup than rendering in Fusion 360. The extra steps required ultimately allow for more customization of the renders. Once a scene is setup with lights and objects, then everything can be animated.

This exercise introduces using lights and physical based material shaders in Blender in Maya. To render an image, it must have lights setup in the correct locations to light the object or scene. Varying the intensity and distance of the lights will change the look of the render dramatically. Experiment and render multiple versions of the scene that you create.
