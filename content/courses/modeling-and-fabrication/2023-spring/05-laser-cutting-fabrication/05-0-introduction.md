## Overview

This module covers the fabrication process of a laser cut assembly modeled in Fusion 360. It shows how to make revisions to a digital model in Fusion 360 and the importance of keeping each piece of a model to be fabricated as an individual component. This is necessary to be able to [lay the parts out flat](https://youtu.be/jeQPJHHwVN4) in Fusion 360 to produce and [export a DXF cut file](https://youtu.be/6JFHMV7A9TU) for use on the laser cutter. You will need to [make a laser cutter tool](https://youtu.be/-B6DXF9aE5s) in Fusion 360 and [install a DXF post processor](https://youtu.be/CBu6vl6Bqos). to produce a DXF file of your tool paths. This is the file you will use to cut out your laser cut design.
