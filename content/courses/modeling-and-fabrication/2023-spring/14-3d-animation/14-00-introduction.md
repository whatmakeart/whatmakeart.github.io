## Overview

3D animation brings 3D models to life. An element of change over time in the form of keyframes, allows one to control various aspects of an animation in 3D space. A keyframe is a characteristic of an object or property at a specific moment in time. Two different keyframes at two different times, create animation. Changing how the animation changes from one keyframe to the next is interpolation and contributes to the character and feel of an animation. Camera angles, a variety of shots, and sound effects add finishing touches to an animation.
