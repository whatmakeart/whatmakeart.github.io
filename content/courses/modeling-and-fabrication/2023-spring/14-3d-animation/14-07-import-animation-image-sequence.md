After you have the different scenes of your animations exported as a series of images import them into Adobe Premiere for editing. You can import a folder of images as an image sequence and premier will treat it as a video file. Video editing allows you to jump back and forth from different camera angles. You could simply set up multiple cameras, export each camera's view of your animation and then cut them together in Premiere. This is where you will add pacing to the cuts of your scenes and shots. This video shows [how to setup and organize your Premiere Project](https://youtu.be/zf8IDYvvUkY).
