## Overview

After the ideation and iterative sketching phase of the design process, initial ideas for a 3D printing projects must be translated from sketch lines to 3D geometry in 3D modeling software. The parametric modeling features of Fusion 360 are well suited for 3D printing since it is easy to modify and change parameters to update a design. T-splines in combination with solid modeling can create most forms imaginable, but not all. Even if a form may be possible in Fusion 360, it might not be the most practical method to achieve some designs. Polygon mesh 3D modeling programs such as Blender or Maya can achieve some forms better and in less time than Fusion 360. Polygon mesh modeling software lacks the parametric precision of CAD orientated software like Fusion 360, but makes up for this limitation with much more freedom and ease of direct manipulation of the 3D model. As you explore 3D modeling for 3D printed output, this module introduces the basics of polygon mesh modeling in Blender and Maya.
