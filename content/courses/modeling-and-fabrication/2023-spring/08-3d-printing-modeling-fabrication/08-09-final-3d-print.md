## Assignment Overview

Print the final version of your 3D Print design at the think[box] on the Ultimaker 2+ or on the industrial 3D printers at the think[box]. You can also print your 3D print at the Digital Output Center, (DOC). If you use the industrial 3D printers at the think[box] or the DOC then you do not have to print it yourself. Rather, you order it online.

Once you have your print, then clean up any support material, put on any finishes, such as paint.
