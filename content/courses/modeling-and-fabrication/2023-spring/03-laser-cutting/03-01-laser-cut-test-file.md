We will go to the think[box] to learn how to use the laser cutters.
We will each make a test cut from a file that we make. You need to have this
file made before going to the think[box]. There are specific instructions to make
the file in Adobe Illustrator. If you do not follow the directions then your
file will not work properly on the laser cutters.

The test cut will demonstrate the ability of a through cut and an etching cut on the laser cutters.
