## Overview

This module introduces laser cutting as a digital fabrication process. Laser cutting can cut all the way through a material or etch on its surface. Laser cutting is a quick way to rapidly prototype and test ideas and concepts. It can make parts with high accuracy and repeatability. It is limited to creating flat pieces of relatively thin thickness.

## Learning Outcomes

- Use Adobe Illustrator to make laser cut file for test cut
- Use Epilog laser cutting software to cut and etch wood and plastic
- Create iterative designs and ideation sketches
- Refine designs for assembly and fabrication
- Fabricate scale models in cardboard
