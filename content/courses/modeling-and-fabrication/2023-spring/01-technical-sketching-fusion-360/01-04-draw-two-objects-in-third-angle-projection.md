## Assignment Deliverables

Upload 2 separate, labeled JPEGs of 2 different objects drawn in third angle projection on paper. One is drawn freehand and one is drawn with technical drawing tools.

Label the files:

- YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname object in third angle projection freehand.jpg
- YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname object in third angle projection tsquare.jpg

## Instructions

1. Select two objects of reasonable size and complexity. You do not want super tiny objects or mega huge objects. You also don't want objects that are a simple square or objects made of hundreds of intricate parts.

2. Use digital calipers and rulers to get the dimensions of the objects. Write these dimensions down in your notes. Use mm for your units.

3. Using loose sheets of paper, <span>not</span> in your sketchbooks, draw the two objects that you selected in third angle projection. Draw one third angle projection freehand and one with drawing tools.

4. Plan out your drawing based on the dimensions and your paper size. If your object is too small to draw at 1:1 real world scale, use a scaled ruler to scale the drawing up with 2mm = 1mm or other appropriate scale factor [Here is a link to a scaled ruler that you can print out](2022-half-scale-mm-printable-ruler.pdf). This ruler has 2mm marks divided into 10. There are many other scaled rulers available online. If you object is larger, such as a game controller, then you can draw at 1:1 scale where 1mm = 1mm. For this assignment avoid super large objects that would need to be scaled down.

5. You should draw one third angle projection freehand without using your drafting / technical drawing tools. Drawing accurate third angle productions freehand is an important drawing communicative skill.Â  The lines do not need to be perfectly straight or perfectly proportioned but try to make sure that the drawing is an accurate representation of the object. Measure the proportions and keep everything aligned and in proportion.

6. Write the dimensions on your freehand third angle projections. Mark metric somewhere on the page and note the units as mm. Label each view, Front, Top, Side/Right.

7. Draw a second third angle projection using your drafting / technical drawing tools. You will need your drawing board, T-Square, 45 degree triangle, 30/60 degree triangle, compass and ruler. Draw a neat and accurate third angle projection. Use your T-Square, compass, and triangles.

8. Write the dimensions on your freehand third angle projections. Mark metric somewhere on the page and note the units as mm. Label each view, Front, Top, Side/Right. Use your T-Square and triangles to draw straight lines for the dimensions. Think about where you put the dimensions so it is clear and legible by anyone.

9. Cleanly scan both sketches.

10. Label and upload your images.
