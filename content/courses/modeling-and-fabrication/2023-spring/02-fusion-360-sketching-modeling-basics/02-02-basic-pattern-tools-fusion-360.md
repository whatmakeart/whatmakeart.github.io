## Examples of Patterns in the Environment

**Examples of Rectangular Patterns:** The windows in a building, legs of a table or chair, drawers in a cabinet, buttons on a game controller, wheels on a car, pixels on a computer monitor, and the aisles in a retail store are all layed out in neat rectangular rectangular patterns.

Where else do you see rectangular patterns?

**Examples of Circular Patterns:** The blades on a drone, cutouts on a custom car rim, bars on a merry-go-round, ridges on a cut drinking glass, grid fins on a rocket, nubs on the grip handle of a mountain bike, and are examples of circular patterns.

**Examples of Patterns Along a Path:** The lamp posts along a winding parkway, LEDs in a fancy car headlight, cut outs in an organic chair, and ridges along the grip of a cordless drill are examples of patterns along a path.

## Pattern Tools in Fusion 360

Fusion 360 allows you to create patterns of objects or features. This is a powerful way to make complex additions to a model in a quick and editable way. You can create a rectangular pattern, a circular pattern, or a pattern on a path.

Examine everyday objects around you and look for different types of patterns.

- **Rectangular Pattern** - Lays out objects or features along a rectangular pattern from a central origin. [Rectangular Pattern Video Demo](https://youtu.be/Y0nYNZvL0EA)
- **Circular Pattern** - Lays out objects or features along a circular pattern from a central origin.
- **Pattern Along a Path** - Lays out objects or features along a custom linear path that can be organic, geometric, or a combination. [Video demonstration of pattern along a path.](https://youtu.be/9xit7JRPQ0A)
