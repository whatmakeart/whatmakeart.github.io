## Assignment Deliverables

- Scale cardboard model of your CNC design

- 2 raw files of post processed photos (dng, arw, cr2)
- Label files YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Cardboard Model Documentation Photos

## Assignment Overview

Make a cardboard model of your design. It is one thing to draw with pencil on paper, it is another to make a physical object. Problems and solutions that may not be apparent in your drawing will reveal themselves when you make a physical object. The model will be smaller than actual size.

You can cut the cardboard with hand tools or the laser cutter or both.

We will be using ¾” or ½” plywood for this project. You can use a ratio to scale your model.

Measure the cardboard and use a ratio calculator to scale your model dimensions.

First calculate the scale factor of your materials. If your single sheet of cardboard measures ~3.3mm and 3/4" plywood is ~18mm then you have a scale factor of 11:60. This website can easily calculate the scale factor for you. [Online Scale Calculator](https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/cm_to_inch/scale_factor_calculator.html)

Once you know the scale factor then you can determine how big the pieces of your cardboard model should be based on that scale factor. This website lets you enter a scale factor and then enter in your final desired design dimension. For example if you want something 30" tall, you put in a scale factor of 11:60, type 30" in the "real length" and set the "scale length" to mm to get the scaled model size in mm. (You can use inches for your cardboard model but millimeters are soooo much easier to use, count, divide. Notice I put in 30" because for some distances. I know imperial units better but then I quickly convert to the easier to use metric system. Make sure you always double check your units.) This website will scale all your numbers.

## Assignment Overview

Take a minimum of two photos of your model. Take one from a 3/4 angle that shows a good representation of the form. Take the other from a composition of your choice. Set up lights and a clean backdrop. You can use the already set up paper backdrop. Remember that putting a single light directly above a small object often gives a great shot. You can check out lights and a camera from the CIA equipment checkout or shoot at the think[box].

Shoot in JPG and RAW and post process the images. [White balance should be corrected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0yZEWUSahk) and the levels should be adjusted to have good exposure. Use Photoshop and [Adobe Camera Raw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11jwSwUu2WI) to make adjustments and to retouch any mistakes in the images.

### What Camera Should I Use?

Use a mirrorless camera or a DSLR camera to take high resolution documentation photos of your artwork. Do not use your cell phone to take documentation photos.

### What Camera and Lights Should I Checkout?

On the [CIA Equipment Checkout Page](https://cia.webcheckout.net/sso/patron#!/) choose one of the [SONY A6100 mirrorless cameras](https://cia.webcheckout.net/sso/patron#!/category/23050497), a [Compact Fluorescent Cool Light Kits](https://cia.webcheckout.net/sso/patron#!/category/15348239), and a [Basic Tripod](https://cia.webcheckout.net/sso/patron#!/category/104834).

## Photograph with Cellphone?

Your pictures will be worse with if you use a cellphone rather than a good camera, period. But if that is all you have, a cell phone is better than nothing and with a little bit of effort fairly decent photos can be made. You should always get a camera with a bigger sensor and better lens than your cellphone but I know that sometimes time runs short. For those instances, the video below shows how to take ok photographs with just a cell phone and a clip on light. There are no excuses for bad images. Remember to shoot both RAW and JPG when using a camera or your cellphone. Most cellphones can be set to shoot RAW images.
