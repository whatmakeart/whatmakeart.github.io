Spend a few minutes to write a brief Story Spine that follows a narrative arc.

In part 1 explain the setting of the story. Where is it? What is seen? What is happening? What is the subject? Perhaps an origin story about the powers?

In part 2 introduce a problem, conflict or goal. What happens because of the magical powers? Are the powers a burden for the character to overcome?

In part 3 resolve part 2\. What is the result of the actions of the character harnesing their powers to overcome?

Writing a Story Spine and Storyboards will give you an outline and direction as you produce your materials. Rather than working with everything possible in the universe, the Story Spine and Story Boards will narrow the scope and set limitations that you can work creatively within.

## What is a Story Arc?

A traditional story arc contains an introduction of the story, plot, characters and setting. This is called the Exposition. This leads into the Rising Action when the character is faced with a problem. The character then confronts obstacles along the way toward the Climax of the story, a moment of crisis that directs the rest of the plot. This is followed by Falling Action as the plot moves from climax to the ending. Finally a Resolution occurs and stability returns to the story.

- **Exposition** – intro of plot, characters and setting
- **Rising Action** – multiple incidents occur providing suspense and tension
- **Climax** – moment of crisis that directs the rest of the plot
- **Falling Action** – plot moves from climax to ending
- **Resolution** – final results of plot - stability returns

A story spine is a concept created by Kenn Adams in the book "The Art of Spontaneous Theater.” It is a simple outline with prompts that assist a storyteller develop a structure for their narrative. We will use this 9 part structure to develop our story to have 3 simple acts.

### 3 Act Narrative Story Spine Structure

You will use the story spine as the foundation for your 3 act narrative structure.

</div>

<div class="half-box" style="flex: 1 1 400px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">

**Act 1 – The first 3 parts of the story spine**

This act sets the scene, introduces characters, shows how the world works. The act leads up to having have the rising action of "But, one day..."

1.  Once upon a time...
2.  Every day...
3.  But, one day...

</div>

<div class="half-box" style="flex: 1 1 400px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">

**Act 2 - The Journey or the "Because of that..." Sequences**

Show the journey of the character and how they overcome obstacles that they encounter. Often includes a low point of the character's journey. Hardship comes to the character as they experience a low point. A series of challenges is presented that lead to the climax or a fork in the road where a decision must be made. After this diction is made that there is often no going back.

1.  Because of that...
2.  Because of that...
3.  Because of that...

</div>

<div class="half-box" style="flex: 1 1 400px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">

**Act 3 - Heading toward the climax and resolution**

The characters must make a choice to overcome the obstacles of Act 2\. This the “Until, finally…” climatic moment of the story arc. This moves the story toward conclusion and resolution. The character demonstrates learning and growth. This often demonstrates the moral of the story.

1.  Until, finally...
2.  And, ever since then...
3.  And the moral of the story is ....

# Storyboards

[Link to Printable Storyboard Sheets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fWi_5xjUC9eDOkhaZ8smU050QQmqBhUY/view?usp=sharing) You can print these for free in black and white in the classroom or in the library.

1.  Begin by writing down many different magical powers you could have or magical items that you could find. Do not limit yourself and be specific.
2.  Review your list and select a few that may be promising.
3.  Develop a story spine by filling out the 9 prompts in a Google Doc.  Revise the story spine. Each part of the story spine should only be a sentence or two.
4.  Once the 3 Acts are developed and written out using the story spine you need to decide how you will show the viewer the story.  Remember there is no dialogue in the story. You must rely on visuals to tell your narrative.
5.  Storyboard every new shot. Sometimes you may need several storyboards per shot if the composition changes over time. **Storyboards should be full panels with captions describing the scene.**

Scan your storyboards as a PDF. Label the PDF YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname 3D Animation Storyboards.pdf. Upload to the Google Drive Folder.
