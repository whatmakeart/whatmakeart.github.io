## Assignment Deliverables

Upload the following items:

1. Exported STL file of model
2. Exported.f3d file of model
3. Render image

## Assignment Overview

The test prints will be small and should fit within a 50mm x 50mm x 50mm box. (50mm is approximately 2 inches) You can see the size of your model in Fusion under properties from the browser.

## Export STL file for 3D Test Print

- Watch the video on the tutorial page to export your model as an STL file.
- Choose File > 3D Print to save your STL Label the file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname 3D Test Print.stl

## Export .f3d file of Model from Fusion 360

- Choose File > Export ... and save a .f3d version of your object.

## Apply materials and Export a Render Image

The 3D print will be a solid color of PLA plastic.

- Choose a color and apply that material to your model.
- Set up a render scene with a 1:1 or 16:9 or 2:3 aspect ratio.
- Make one of the dimensions a minimum of 4000px.
- Export a render image with a good composition.
