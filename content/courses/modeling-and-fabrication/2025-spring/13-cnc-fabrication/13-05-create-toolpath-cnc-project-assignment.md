## Assignment Overview

1. Fix any issues with your model.
2. Double check the "ply" dimension and all other dimensions.
3. Make sure everything is an individual component.
4. Check for [tolerance and fit](../../../../digital-fabrication/cnc/cnc-tolerance-and-fit.md) of any parts that attach or fit together.
5. Switch to the [Manufacture Workspace](https://youtu.be/lXSVlk3FqHc?t=85).
6. Change the Manufacture Workspace units to Inches.
7. If needed create a Manufacturing Model.
