## Assignment Deliverables

1. Exported Maya archive scene file, or Blender file of a 3D Environment (`.zip`, or `.blend`)
   - Label the file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname 3D Animation Environment
2. 2 Render images showing parts of your modeled environment (`.jpg` or `.png`)
   - Label the files YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname 3D Animation Environment Render.png

## Process

Spend 3 hours modeling 3D environments for your [line animation project](./09-13-3d-line-animation-project-assignment.md). Use your story spines and storyboards as a guide. Make camera objects to see if your environment if matching what you want to show in your storyboards.

### 3D Model File Exporting

- If using Maya, export a scene archive so all of your textures and materials are included.
