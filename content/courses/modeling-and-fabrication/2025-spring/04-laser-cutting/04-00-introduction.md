## Overview

This module introduces laser cutting as a digital fabrication process. Laser cutting can cut all the way through a material or etch on its surface. Laser cutting is a quick way to rapidly prototype and test ideas and concepts. It can make parts with high accuracy and repeatability. It is limited to creating flat pieces of relatively thin thickness.

## Learning Outcomes

- Use Adobe Illustrator to make laser cut file for test cut
- Use Epilog laser cutting software to cut and etch wood and plastic
- Create iterative designs and ideation sketches
- Refine designs for assembly and fabrication
- Fabricate scale models in cardboard

## Joints

- butt joint (glued)
- box joint (finger joint)
- lap joint or slotted cross joint (two slots slide together)
- hook joint
- keyed or pinned tennon
- mortise and tennon tab joint
- indexed t slot pin joint

### Types of fit

- clearance or semi loose
- transition or the exact size
- interference or press fit

## Overview

This module continues the design and fabrication process based on the ideation and physical cardboard prototypes you produced. After discussing your ideas and cardboard models with the group, you will make necessary modifications to your design and cardboard prototype. Then we will study how use Fusion 360 to convert a sketch and a cardboard model into a digital 3D model designed for fabrication with a laser cutter. We will examine how to keep the parts as separate components. This project introduces custom [user parameters in Fusion 360](https://youtu.be/H6W-Og4YyZ8). These are like variables for dimensions that we can change and have the model update automatically. The use of user defined parameters is essential for [parametric modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/parametric-modeling.md).

## Learning Objectives

- Use sketch projections in Fusion 360
- Design a modular 3D model in Fusion 360 for laser cutting
- Use separate components for separate parts of the project
- Export rendered images of 3D Model

## Keywords
