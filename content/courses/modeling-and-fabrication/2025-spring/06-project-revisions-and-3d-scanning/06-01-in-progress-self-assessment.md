Now that you have laser cut out at leat one part and 3D printed at least one part, there are probably many things that you would want to do differently if you started your project from scratch. The design process is an iterative process full of successes and setbacks. When we realize something that we should have done in a design it is not a failure, rather it is a success because we have learned something about the design process and our project.

Reflect on your design process including the ideation process, the digital modeling process in Fusion 360, the physical output laser cutting, the 3D printing process, and the assembly fit process. Answer the questions below about your project.

## Questions

1. How did laser cutting go? What issues did you run into? What would you do differently?
2. How did 3D printing go? What issues did you run into? What would you do differently?
3. What is your favorite part of your design / project? Why?
4. What would you change about how you designed your 3D model in Fusion 360? Did parts not work out? Would you now take a different approach? Why?
5. Now that you some physical pieces of your formally digital only model, what do you think? Was the scale what you expected? What would you redesign about the project? Why? Be specific.
6. What challenges did you face and how did you attempt to overcome them?
