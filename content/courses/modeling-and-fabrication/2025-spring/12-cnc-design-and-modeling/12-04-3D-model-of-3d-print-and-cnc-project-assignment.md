## Assignment Deliverables

1. Exported Fusion 360 File (.f3d file) [How to Export Fusion 360 .f3d File](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/export-f3d-file-fusion-360.md)
   - Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname CNC Project Model.f3d
2. One Rendering of CNC Project with appearances applied. Should be in a 4:3 1:1 or 16:9 aspect ration with one side at least 4000px (.png or .jpg)
   - Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname CNC Project Rendering.f3d

## Assignment Overview

1. Using your revised sketches, identify the different parts of your project. Each of these parts will be a different component in the Fusion 360 model.
2. Think about how you will construct and assemble the pieces. Will you use tabs and slots? How will they work?
3. Make sure that no parts overlap each other, especially where any joints are. Under the Inspect tab in Fusion 360, use the "interference" tool to check for overlapping parts.
4. Apply materials and make a rendering of the project.
