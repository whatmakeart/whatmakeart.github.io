1. How did cutting a test project from boxes.py with the laser cutter influence your ideation process?
2. Assess your ideation process. Did you push yourself to make multiple different ideas or did you settle on the first one? After makeing multiple ideas, did you iterate and make variations of the base concepts?
3. What did you learn about your design from making a three dimensional cardboard model?
4. What would you revise or change about your design? Why?
