## Assignment Deliverables

- Scale cardboard model of your CNC design - [Scale Cardboard to Plywood](../../../../making/scale-cardboard-to-plywood.md)
- 2 post processed photos from 2 angles of your cardboard model (jpg, png)
- 2 raw files of post processed photos (dng, arw, cr2)
- Label files YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname Cardboard Model Documentation Photos

## Assignment Overview

Take a minimum of two photos of your model. Take one from a 3/4 angle that shows a good representation of the form. Take the other from a composition of your choice. Set up lights and a clean backdrop. You can use the already set up paper backdrop. Remember that putting a single light directly above a small object often gives a great shot. You can check out lights and a camera from the CIA equipment checkout or shoot at the think[box].

Shoot in JPG and RAW and post process the images. [White balance should be corrected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0yZEWUSahk) and the levels should be adjusted to have good exposure. Use Photoshop and [Adobe Camera Raw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11jwSwUu2WI) to make adjustments and to retouch any mistakes in the images.
