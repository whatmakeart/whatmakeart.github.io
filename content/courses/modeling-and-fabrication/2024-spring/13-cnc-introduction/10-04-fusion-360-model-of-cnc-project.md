## Assignment Overview

1. Using your revised sketches and scale cardboard model, identify the different parts of your project. Each of these parts will be a different component in the Fusion 360 model.
2. Think about how you will construct and assemble the pieces. Will you use tabs and slots? How will they work?
3. Make sure that no parts overlap each other, especially where the joints are. Under the Inspect tab in Fusion 360, use the "interference" tool to check for overlapping parts.
4. Apply materials and make a rendering of the project.
5. Switch to the Manufacture Workspace.
6. [Create a manufacture model](../../../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/make-manufacture-model-copy-fusion-360.md).
7. Right click on the manufacture model to edit.
8. Draw a sketch on the ground plane to represent the 24" x 60" piece of plywood.
9. Use arrange tool to place all the parts flat on the sketch. If all of the parts do not fit, then you will need to use a bigger piece of plywood. Edit the size of the plywood sketch until the parts fit or change the size of the model until the parts fit.
10. Take a screenshot or make a rendering of your parts laid flat. To make the screenshot or rendering more interesting, unhide the assembled model so you can see the flat parts and the assembled model at the same time.
