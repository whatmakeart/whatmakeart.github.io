## Overview

Fusion 360 creates 3D models for fabrication and physical output. Models to create fabricated physical object not the only product that can be made by 3D modeling. Images, animations, games assets, visual effects, virtual reality, and augmented reality all stay within the digital realm yet still use 3D modeling. Often when 3D modeling for digital output a more fluid form of modeling is required. "CAD like" programs such as Fusion 360 are great for their intended purpose but can be an inhibitor to sketching and creativity since everything tends to work best when defined in a precise way. Of course one could make a Fusion 360 model without dimensions or sketch constraints but that would defeat the point of Fusion 360's parametric modeling precision.

Polygon modeling programs such as [Blender](../../../../3d-modeling/blender/blender.md) and [Maya](../../../../3d-modeling/maya/maya.md), lack the easily accessed precision and parametric features of Fusion 360, but make up for it in quick workflows and quick direct modeling manipulation. They also offer easier ways to add lighting and physical based materials to great stunning imagery and animations. Polygon modeling programs also have physics and simulation engines for cloth, collisions and other dynamic components.

Neither type of modeling is better than the other, they are for different purposes. It is important to understand multiple 3D modeling paradigms to become better at your craft.

It is also important to understand the fundamental concepts of 3D modeling. We will use both Maya and Blender to study the fundamental concepts of 3D modeling such as extrude, scale, rotate, subdivide, shaders, meshes, vertices, quads, loops, etc. It is important to understand the theoretical concepts, then you can use any software.
