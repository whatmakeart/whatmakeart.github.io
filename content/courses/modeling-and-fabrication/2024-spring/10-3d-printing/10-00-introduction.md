## Overview

This module introduces 3D Printing as a way to output digital models into the physical world. 3D printing is a quick way to be able to produce a physical model in order to hold a complex 3D model in your hands. Some models and forms can only be made by 3D printing and are not possible with traditional manufacturing or fabrication techniques. 3D printing is an additive process, meaning material is added to existing material rather than being cut away such as with a saw, laser cutter, CNC, or waterjet. [T-Splines](https://youtu.be/8vGrRR_TLEg) in Fusion 360 allow for the creation of organic forms than can be combined with parametric models to create decorative and functional parts.

## Learning Objectives

- Model organic forms with T-splines in Fusion 360
- Combine T-splines with parametrically modeled features
- Scale a model to a desired size
- Measure a model in software
- Export an STL file for 3D printing

## Key Terms

- FFF 3D Printing
- T-Spline
- Manifold / Watertight
- STL
- Build envelope
- Bounding Box
- Filament

## Overview

Before working on a final version of a project it is important to understand the
process. To better understand FFF 3D printing, we will make small test prints.
This will familiarize you with how to export an STL file, how to use slicing
software to prepare your file, how to load filament into the printer, what can
go wrong with overhangs and supports, and other intangibles that are only
learnable through experience. We will keep the 3D print test prints small so
when inevitable problems occur not a lot of time or material is wasted. It is a
good idea to make multiple test prints, making changes to your model based on
how the print turns out.

## Learning Objectives

- Slice STL file in Cura
- Add supports and raft as needed to print
- Load PLA filament onto 3D Printer
- Select file and successfully print a test print
- Clean up supports and raft
- Photo document small objects in a professional way

## Key Terms

- Cura
- Support
- Raft
- PLA
- Slicer
- ISO
- Shutter Speed
- Depth of Field
- F-Stop
