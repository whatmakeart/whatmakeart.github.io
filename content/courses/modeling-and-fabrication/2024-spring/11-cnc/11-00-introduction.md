## Overview

We will continue learning parametric modeling in Fusion 360. Parametric modeling allows us to change our design depending on the materials that will be used to fabricate it as well as certain parameters that we might want to change for different users. In the previous project we learned about user parameters. We will continue to use user parameters in our designs and learn how to use formulas to make other dimensions driven by parameters. We may want to easily customize a design and fabricate it at a different height without actually remodeling everything. With parametric modeling we can set the height of a stool or table as a user parameter in our model and then have other dimensions of the design driven by that height. Simply typing a new value for the height will update the rest of the model.

Everything is not a nail.

We will combine 3D printing and CNC machining to focus on the strengths and weaknesses of each digital fabrication process.
