We will use the power of [parametric modeling](../../../../3d-modeling/parametric-modeling.md) in Fusion 360 to design an assembly that will be laser cut out of plywood or acrylic. The laser cutters can cut plywood and acrylic from 1/8" to 1/4" thick.

This project will use the entire design process.

- identifying the problem
- ideation and iteration
- refinement of ideas
- testing of ideas through physical models
- making of a digital model base on those tests
- outputting a physical prototype through a laser cutter

## Process

### Initial Thinking

- Do you need to store something or organize it?
- Do you always loose your keys and phone?
- Do you have a very special paint brush that needs a special case?
- Do you need a laser cut robot arm that looks like a skeleton?

1. Think of the times that you use an object or routinely perform a task, or store something. What could be designed to improve that experience?
2. Conduct research of existing solutions to the problem. You will not "copy" anything but you should be aware of what exists. It can inspire your and spark new ideas in your mind. Do an internet image search with your concept as a search term.
3. Search of [laser cut objects](https://www.google.com/search?q=laser+cut+objects&tbm=isch) to see what laser cutters can make.
