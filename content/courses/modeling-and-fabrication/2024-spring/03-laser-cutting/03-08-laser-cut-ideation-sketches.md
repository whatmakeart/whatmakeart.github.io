## Ideation Sketches

1. After initial design research, begin by drawing [ideation sketches](../../../../drawing/ideation-sketches.md) of solutions. At this stage try to draw many different ideas without censoring your thoughts. No idea is bad at this point.
2. Draw many ideas with different contours and solutions to the problem.
3. Draw a minimum of 10 ideation sketches of different designs and ideas. Each idea should be new and unique.
4. Draw your ideations sketches large enough. The maximum number of ideation sketches on a single page (~8.5"x11" sheet) is 6-8 sketches. Any more and they are too small.
5. You can make your sketches via analog or digital techniques or both. If you use digital techniques, the maximum number of ideation sketches on a single screen size document is 6-8 sketches. Any more and they are too small.

## Idea Sketch Refinement

1. After an initial out of ideation go back through your sketches and see which ones seem promising.
2. Choose five of these ideas and refine them and redraw them larger. Pay attention to showing how the pieces of the stand would go together. Try to draw them as solid things in three-dimensional space on your page.
3. Draw a minimum of 3 refined sketch ideas.
4. Draw your refined sketches large enough. The maximum number of refined sketches on a single page (~8.5"x11" sheet) is 2-3 sketches. Any more and they are too small.
5. You can make your sketches via analog or digital techniques or both. If you use digital techniques, the maximum number of refined sketches on a single screen size document is 2-3 sketches. Any more and they are too small.
