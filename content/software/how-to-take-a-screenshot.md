## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial you should be familiar with basic computer operation, and digital file handling.

## Instructions

### On Windows

Depending on your hardware, you may use the **Windows Logo Key +** **PrtScn** button as a shortcut for print screen. If your device does not have the **PrtScn** button, you may use **Fn + Windows logo key  + Space Bar** to take a screenshot, which can then be printed.

To locate your screenshots, open **File Explorer** from the taskbar. On the side navigation pane, select the **Pictures** folder, and select **Screenshots.**
