Rephotography can refer to the photographing of the same object or location at different times.

The term "rephotography" or "rephotographic" comes from _The Rephotographic Survey Project_ made in 1977 by Mark Klett, Ellen Manchester, and JoAnn Verburg. They photographed or "rephotographed" the same locations as previous photographs of locations of the American West from the nineteenth century. A conceptual part of the project was to attempt to accurately recreated the origina lphotogrphy by setting the camera in the same location and mataching the time of year and time of day of the original photograph. [^Klett-rephotography] Later in 1998 Klett revisited the sites to rephotograph them again for a _Third View_ project.[^Fox-third-view]
