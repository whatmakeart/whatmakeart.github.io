A cyanotype uses light sensitive chemicals placed directly on a variety of materials. Then it is exposed to light before being washed with water to create a blue tinted image. Often physical objects are placed directly on photochemical coated surfaces before being left in direct sunlight. This can create interesting shapes and gradients in the final images as the sunlight passes around the objects.
