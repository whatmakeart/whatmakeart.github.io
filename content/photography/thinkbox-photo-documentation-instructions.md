Below are instructions provided by Case Western Reserve University's think[box] for using the Photo Documentation Stand to document smaller objects. [^1] These instructions are for objects that are approximately 12" max in all directions. This works for most 3D prints and many laser cut projects. If you want to photo document a larger object, then following the [instructions for using the photo backdrop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OY9IOG0cnc62f2EDfT1eCdGRUC8D3gzCYLxreg2P2S8/edit?usp=sharing) will work better.

Either way, you will need to [hook up the camera to the remote flash](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nhp7csZHUI2NY57NjnErvM0S3Ojgz3HDJc9PjQadqRs/edit?usp=sharing). By following the [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nhp7csZHUI2NY57NjnErvM0S3Ojgz3HDJc9PjQadqRs/edit?usp=sharing) you can get even lighting to create dynamic, professional images of your projects.
