Photography is one of the main ways you will document the creative works that you make for presentation to others. Most people will not see your work in person, but we'll see documentation in your portfolio. The quality of your documentation of your artwork will often determine someone's response to it and whether or not they like it around. Is important to know how to use a camera to create high resolution while exposed images of your artwork. Understanding [basic camera settings](basic-camera-settings.md) is the foundation of creating images with a camera.
