When you're using a brush in Photoshop and all you see is a crosshair instead of the full brush outline, it can be frustrating, especially if you're trying to work with precision. This issue usually happens because the Caps Lock key is turned on. The Caps Lock key toggles between showing the full outline of your brush and just the crosshair, which is intended for more precise work.

## Quick Fix:

- **Press Caps Lock:** Simply pressing the Caps Lock key will switch between the crosshair and the normal brush outline. If you only see a crosshair, pressing Caps Lock should bring back the full brush outline. Press it again to return to the crosshair view.

### Customizing Brush Cursor Preferences:

If you want more control over how your brush cursor appears, you can adjust these settings directly in Photoshop:

1. Go to `Edit` (Windows) or `Photoshop` (Mac) > Preferences > Cursors
2. Choose your preferred brush tip: Here, you can select between different options:
   - Normal Brush Tip: Displays the brush size that corresponds to the brush's soft edges.
   - Full Size Brush Tip: Shows the entire brush tip size, including any feathered edges.
   - Show Crosshair in Brush Tip: This option adds a crosshair to the center of your brush, which can be helpful for precise placement.

By adjusting these settings, you can customize your brush appearance to suit your workflow. However, the most common reason for not seeing your full brush outline is the Caps Lock being on, so always check that first.

## Summary:

- Caps Lock toggles between crosshair and full brush outline.
- Preferences allows for further customization of brush cursor appearance.

With these tips, you should be able to switch back to your preferred brush view and continue working smoothly in Photoshop. Happy photoshopping!
