TL;DR DPI doesn't matter

Pixel dimensions or the number of pixels high and the number of pixels wide, is the only thing that matters about digital images.

Even Photoshop swaped out DPI for resolution in its New File dialog window. Each of these images are exactly the same even though one has a resolution of 1 pixel per inch, one has a resolution of 72 pixels per inch, and one has a resolution of 300 pixels per inch. They all have the same pixel dimensions and therefore the same potential ammount of digital image information.

DPI refers to Dots Per Inch and is used when printing on physical materials.

PPI refers to Pixels Per Inch and is use d to define the pixel density of an electronic display.

Resolution is a vague term that might refer to either DPI, PPI, or neither.
