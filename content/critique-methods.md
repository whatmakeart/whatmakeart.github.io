## Essential Parts of Any Critique Statement

What do you see? What do you think about it? Why do you think that?

## Critique Methods

Use a one minute. In the beginning of critique to have everyone describe things don't let people describe more than one thing after having trouble getting people to participate then go all the way across the room and have everyone describe one thing then move to the interpretation phase try that for a new critique Change-Up

## Guess the work by student created titles

Have students sit in front of 4 different works and write for 3 minutes. At the end of the 3 minutes I have them write a 3-5 word phrase that would allow the class to accurately pick the composition out from all the others in the class. Names like “portal to the wrong swamp" come up.

Give groups of three forms to fill out about other people's work. They have to go to work that was not in one of the group of 3. Each of the group members has to write down information one time. Put markers on top of the work after it is completed it so that no one else goes to that work. When you do the full critique then have the artist say the answers in their own words about their own piece. Then we had the person who wrote in the group with the group thought and sometimes people disagreed. Then we had a brief discussion that seemed to work well

# How to Critique Art

## What is a Critique?

Many forms of critique exist but for now we will discuss the formal group critique found in many art schools around the world. It is essential to your training as creative professionals and will take time to master.

“A critique happens when a group of people convenes in an art studio or critique room to discuss and evaluate works of art. Depending on the class level, the school’s resources, and the area of study, the group is comprised of a combination of students, one or several instructors, and sometimes other invited participants, usually thought of as experts.” [^1]

We fall into that listing. We have students and instructors - “the experts.” We could also travel outside of that narrow definition as we explore the full range of creative pursuits but in the beginning we will follow more traditional models in order to know what to change.

## Why is this important?

In order to grow and improve we must know what we accomplish well and what we do not. This allows us to begin what Malcolm Gladwell calls “determined practice.” If we do not constantly evaluate our progress with an aim towards improvement then we merely participate in a hobby.

Discussing work as a group fosters community and an environment for discourse. You will rise with your peers and must develop relationships in order to succeed.

The critique also allows us to objectively evaluate a work without personal biases interfering. Although absolute objectivity is not possible we must remember to leave ourselves at the door. Always remember that the discussion is about an inanimate object and not about the person that created the object. Do not take comments either positive or negative as judgment of you.

## How do we critique?

The critiques in this class will take various forms but will usually involve a group of students and the instructor verbally discussing work produced for assigned prompts and problems. Therefore there will be outside criteria available to evaluate the work in relation to the stated goals of an assignment. As you move through your coursework these arbitrary measures of a work’s success may become less clear.

The success of the critique requires everyone’s participation both verbally and through written word. In order to become fully developed creative professionals you must develop both your listening skills as well as your ability to analyze your peers’ work. Failure to listen is a common shortcoming as is the failure to engage your peers. This is hard work and you must practice.

## Objectives

- Develop a vocabulary for discussing and evaluating visual artifacts in the world
- Improve our skills at making through critical analysis of progress
- Build a community of peers to create a safe environment of inquiry, experimentation and risk taking
- Learn how to communicate complex visual concepts through both verbal and written form
