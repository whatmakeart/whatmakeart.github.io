The design process serves as the essential workflow and approach for creators and makers. Attempting to jump straight to a finished idea or product is a seductive trap, usually leading to wasted time, materials and frustration. By embracing an iterative cycle, you allow the project to evolve through trial and error, identifying flaws while they’re still just concepts rather than structural failures. The design process almost always begins with the low stakes thinking and sketching, where ideas can be tested, trashed, and refined in a space where the only cost of a mistake is a bit of paper and some time.
