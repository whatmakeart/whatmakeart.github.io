**If you do not write any of the words of a contract it is likely not written in your best interest.**

## Contract Changes

Remember Mutual Assent?

- Both parties have to agree. So if you do not agree, change the agreement until you can agree.
- This is a negotiation process. In some situations you will have little power to negotiate in others you will have much more.
- Remember to not only look for things to “remove” from a contract, look for missing things as well that you need to add.
- Don’t be afraid to ask.
- Do you really want to work with someone who is mad at you for asking about a contract? They may not agree to the proposed changes but you should always ask.

### Examples of Additions and Clarifications

- Where is the electricity? How many amps? Whose power cords?
- How many volunteers? Art handlers?

- Is the gallery open daily? Or only once a month?
- Is the exhibition only of your work or a group show?
- How many works in the show?
- Who hangs the work?
- Who buys plane tickets? Do you get reimbursed later or get a ticket sent to you?
- Will equipment be rented? Who pays? How many days?
- What about insurance? Liability?
- Can they take photos of your work and sell them?
- How long can you use my images / video for publicity and paid advertising?

## Boilerplate Provisions

Can seem like a lot but matter when needed. Make sure to read and understand all of them.

### Boilerplate Clauses

#### Warranties

- Promises or assurances made by either party. Especially important in commission work.  You will warrantee that the painting or ceramic piece won’t fall apart.

#### Notice

- How will the parties contact each other? Registered mail? Email? What address? This is important for payment, termination and force majeure.

#### Relationships

- Not the romantic kind. Usually prevents parties from claiming a business relationship.  Allows for contract work and avoiding workers compensation and payroll taxes.

#### Indemnification

- A ”hold harmless” provision. It is a transfer of risk. It shifts potential costs from one party to another.
- Can be one way or two way. Always try to get a mutual indemnification.
- Protects the party from losses from third party claims. Copyright is a good example.
- You will also likely “warranty” that you own the copyright of your work but an indemnification clause add additional protection.

#### Choice of law

- What law will you use? Generally you will be in the same State but with out of State agreements this can begin to matter.

#### Jurisdiction

- Similar to above but decides where any lawsuits or other court actions must be filed.  If you have to file in California, it may cause additional expenses.

#### Force Majeure

- Floods, terrorism, tornadoes, hurricanes, sink holes, Covid-19 – what happens with these events – unlikely but should be in there. If it is a specific list of situation it may offer less protection then more broad and vague terms.

#### Assignment

- Allows or does not allow the parties to transfer rights in the contract to other people. Common in artist contracts, if you contract Anish Kapoor to decorate your living room, you don’t want Anish to “assign” that right to someone off the street.

#### Attachments

- Very common in artist contracts. Sometimes called “exhibits” but are just documents that are attached to the contract and become part of the agreement.  Often referred to in the text of the contract.

#### Integration

- States that the contract represents the total or the final agreement of the parties. If you have an email that says you get paid 1,000,000 but the contract says 100, guess what you are getting paid? (Note: there are special laws that govern written correspondence leading up to a contract.  Ask a lawyer.)

#### Headings

- States that headings in the document have no meaning

#### Severability

- Allows the contract to stand and be enforced if one part is invalid.  You contract with a gallery and it says artist responsible for robbing a bank.  The rest of the contract is still valid, including you getting paid, even if the invalid bank clause is taken out, if you have a severability clause.
- This is in the current news with the potential invalidation of the Affordable Care Act by the Supreme Court.

## Do I need a lawyer?

Yes, you do.

- It may not be necessary as you sign some basic agreements in the beginning of your career but there is a threshold where it is a good idea to hire an attorney.
- Is your threshold $100? $1,000? $10,000? $100,000?
- In your career you will handle many similar contracts.  After you use an attorney on a certain type, you are likely able to handle that type of contract on your own in the future.
- It is a good idea to hire an attorney again if you need a new type of contract or if the stakes significantly increase.
- Remember, there are free resources available.
