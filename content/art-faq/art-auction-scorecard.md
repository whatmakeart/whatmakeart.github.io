Before donating your artwork to a benefit auction at a gallery or museum ask yourself these questions about the auction to see if you are being taken advantage of.

1. Is a percentage of sale price given to artist?
2. Does the artist have a choice to keep that percentage or donate it if they choose?
3. Is the minimum bid the market price for the artist?
4. If there a ticket price for the event, does an artist receive a ticket? 2? 1?
5. Does the artist need to forfeit their portion of sale to receive a ticket?
6. Does the venue tell the artist who purchased their work and provide contact info?
7. Does the venue insure the work?

An artist should always have _the option_ of receiving a 50% share of the sale price. An artist should always receive a free ticket to offset their time and labor of bringing the work to and _possibly_ from the space.
