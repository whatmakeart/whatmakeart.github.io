title: How to Write an Artist Statement
---

This tutorial will show you different ways to approaching writing an artist statement. Following this guide you will be able to produce an artist statement that reflects your practice and provides insight into your work for the viewer.

## What is an Artist Statement?

An artist statement is a curious intellectual exercise required by many applications for artist opportunities such as grants, exhibitions, residencies, public commissions, university teaching jobs. Museums sometimes print excerpts from artist statements on the walls of an exhibition as didactic, or explanatory text for the audience. Students are generally required to write artist statements in BFA and MFA programs. Artist statements are usually written by the artist who created a particular work of art. The content is up to the author, but artist statements generally include a description of the work, cultural influences, and an explanation of the work. Some statements also include biographical information and personal details about the artist's thoughts and life.

## Do I Need to Write an Artist Statement?

No.

You do not need an artist statement. You can have a successful career as an artist without every writing an artist statement. Much of the insistence of artists writing artist statement comes from inertia, or the tendency of things the remain as they are. Since previous people had to write artist statements, the next people think they need to write one too.

The MacDowell Colony artist residency application **does not** require or ask for an artist statement. It does ask for a "Visual Summary Description" of two to five words as well as a project description of "... the project you intend to create at MacDowell." The application ask for a "Work Sample Explanation: Tell us how your work sample(s) relate to and support your proposed project." [^1] Notice that the application does not as about what influences artists have from art history or for a specific statement about the work. Rather the application ask for more direct and specific information about the artist's intended project and how past work relates to the completion of the proposed project. While an "artist statement" isn't required, it is required to write about your work.

Although an artists statement is an unnecessary convention of the art world, it **is** a good idea to spend som time intentionally thinking about your artistic practice and why you are doing what you do. Otherwise you would continue thoughtlessly into the future with the same inertia as the convention of writing artist statements.

## Instructions

The first step is to forget most of what you think you know about artist statements and the perceived need to connect to arbitrary art historical contexts. Forcing a connection to art history when it is not present is counterproductive. Your art is not made in a vacuum so there are cultural connections to your work from outside yourself. Identifying and investigating influences and connections in your work is important.

Focus on answering questions. What questions? Think about how you feel when you walk into an art exhibit. What do you want to know? What would you ask the artist if they were standing next to you?

Some questions you might have for an artist:

- Why did you make this work?
- Why did you use these materials?
- How did you make it? Could you talk about the process?
- Do you like how it turned out?

## Do's of Writing An Artist Statement

1. **Be direct.** Get to the point. Write in clear sentences. Most people will not read your entire artist statement. Make sure you have a succinct summary of your message in the first few sentences.
2. **Keep it brief.** Your audience is more likely to completely read and comprehend your artist statement if it is not too long. This means that you need to use language efficiently to quickly and clearly talk about your art.
3. **Talk about process.** As an artist, you can easily forget that not everyone works with oil paint, clay, welded steel, fabric, 3D printers, or the myriad of other artistic techniques. Your audience is likely wondering how you made your work. Satisfy their curiosity by telling them about the process you use to make your work.
4. **Forget about "art history"** Remember that you need to be direct and brief? How will you adequately explain a direct influence from art history in a meaningful way while keeping your audience's attention? It is not impossible but difficult. Unless you truly could not stop thinking about a particular artist, artwork, or movement from art history while you made the piece, then it is probably best not to talk about art history. Instead, talk about the "real" influences on the work? This could be art history but also includes music, pop culture, your friends and family, your arbitrary lived experience and other thoughts that are likely more specific and meaningful than the influence from a few other works of art.
5. **Have someone read it.** Have a friend or better, a stranger read your artist statement. Watch them while they read it. Look for any moments that they lose interest or seem confused. After they are finished ask them if they were bored or engaged. Ask them to tell you what they think you meant by the statement without looking back at the text. They will likely use different words than you. Some of the words they use could be better and clearer ways of explaining your work.

### Historical Artist Statements

> I was walking along the road with two friends — the sun was setting The sky suddenly turned bloody red I stopped, leaned against the fence, tired to death. Over the the blue-black fjord and city lay blood in tongues of fire My friends walked on and I stood there quaking with angst. And I felt as though a vast, endless scream passed through nature.
> Edvard Munch - Written in a diary and on the frame of the 1895 version of the _The Scream_ [^2]

Are there any art historical references in Edvard Munch's statement on _The Scream_? Does the artist use any art speak or strange jargon?
