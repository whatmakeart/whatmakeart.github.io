This tutorial will show you different ways to approaching writing an artist statement. Following this guide you will be able to produce an artist statement that reflects your practice and provides insight into your work for the viewer.

## What is an Artist Statement?

## Instructions

The first step is to forget most of what you think you know about artist statements and the perceived need to connect to arbitrary art historical contexts. Forcing a connection to art history when it is not present is counterproductive. Your art is not made in a vacuum so there are cultural connections to your work from outside yourself. Identifying and investigating influences and connections in your work is important.

Focus on answering questions. What questions? Think about how you feel when you walk into an art exhibit. What do you want to know? What would you ask the artist if they were standing next to you?

Some questions you might have for an artist:

- Why did you make this work?
- Why did you use these materials?
- How did you make it? Could you talk about the process?
- Do you like how it turned out?

## Do's of Writing An Artist Statement

1. Be direct. Get to the point. Write in clear sentences. Most people will not read your entire artist statement. Make sure you have a succinct summary of your message in the first few sentences.

### Historical Artist Statements

> I was walking along the road with two friends — the sun was setting The sky suddenly turned bloody red I stopped, leaned against the fence, tired to death. Over the the blue-black fjord and city lay blood in tongues of fire My friends walked on and I stood there quaking with angst. And I felt as though a vast, endless scream passed through nature.
> Edvard Munch - Written in a diary and on the frame of the 1895 version of the _The Scream_ [^1]

Are there any art historical references in Edvard Munch's statement on _The Scream_? Does the artist use any art speak or strange jargon?
