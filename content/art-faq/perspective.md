Linear perspective creates the illusion of [depth](depth.md) through the use of a horizon line and one or more vanishing points.

## One Point Perspective

One point perspective as a single vanishing point on the horizon line.

## Two Point Perspective

Two point perspective has two vanishing points on the horizon line.

[Atmospheric Perspective](atmospheric-perspective.md) is the visual phenomenon of distant objects appearing less detailed, less saturated, and lower contrast than near objects due to the scattering of light on small particles.
