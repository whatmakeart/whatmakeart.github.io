To appropriate means to take something for your own and as often synonymous with theft, stealing, taking, or poaching.[^cambridge-appropriation] It can also mean a specific amount of money set aside for a specific use such as Appropriations or Budget Bills in Congress.[^cbo] In both cases appropriation has connotations of acquiring and or use of a thing, sometimes with permission and sometimes without.

In a 1982 article in _The New York Times_, Andy Grudberg describes appropriation, or using someone else's work, and says it may call "...into question modernist orthodoxy concerning originality as well as the entire notion of an avant-garde ..." but also might just be theft.[^grundberg]
