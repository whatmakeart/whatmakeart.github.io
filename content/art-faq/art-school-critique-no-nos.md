# Critique No, No’s

(Not allowed without an explanation, give a reason why you think what you do)

Analyze the good and the bad. Keep personal feelings out of the way. Look at the work, what do you see? What do you think about the content as it relates to the assignment objectives? Tell us why. (an evolving and changing student driven collection)
