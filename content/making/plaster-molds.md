Plaster molds use [plaster](plaster.md) to form the negative shell of the mold. Plaster molds are used in [slip casting](slip-casting.md) since the cured plaster readily absorbs water from the liquid slip leaving a thin cast shell of semi rigid clay.

Since plaster is a rigid material, plaster molds need to avoid [undercuts](undercuts.md) or the mold and / or cast will be damaged since the plaster cannot flex to accommodate the undercut. [Rubber molds](multi-part-rubber-molds.md) have more flexibility and can cast small features and undercuts well.

Plaster should be precisely mixed according to the manufacture's instructions. A [plaster calculator](plaster-calculator.md) can be helpful for mixing non standard amounts of plaster
