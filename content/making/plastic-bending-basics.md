Bending plastic is a process of shaping it into a desired form using heat such as an oven or a [heat gun](../tools/how-to-use-a-heat-gun.md)

## Basics of Bending Plastic

1. **Choose the right plastic.** Not all plastics can be bent. Thermoplastics, such as acrylic, polycarbonate, and ABS, are common types of plastics that can be bent.
2. **Heat the plastic.** The plastic must be heated in order to become pliable enough to bend.
3. **Bend the plastic.** Once the plastic is heated to the appropriate temperature, it can be bent into the desired shape. This can be done by hand, using a jig, or using a specialized bending machine such as a [plastic strip bender](../tools/how-to-use-a-plastic-strip-bender.md)
4. **Cool the plastic.** Once the plastic is bent, it must be cooled in order to retain its shape. This can be done by allowing it to cool at room temperature or by using a quenching medium, such as water or air.

## Tips for Bending Plastic

- Apply heat evenly to the plastic to avoid warping.
- Bend the plastic slowly and carefully to avoid cracking.
- Overbend the plastic slightly to compensate for springback.
- Use a [jig](./jigs.md) or bending machine to ensure accurate bends.
- Cool the plastic slowly and evenly to avoid stress cracks.
- For [bending PVC tubes](./bend-pvc-pipe.md) compressed air can be used as a support inside a sealed pipe to prevent the pipe from collapsing when heated and bent.

## Plastic Bending Safety

- Wear gloves and eye protection when bending plastic.
- Do not heat plastic that give off harmful vapors without proper respiratory protection
- Be careful not to overheat the plastic, as this can cause it to burn or melt.
- Avoid bending plastic with or near open flames.
