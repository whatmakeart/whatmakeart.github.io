Multi part rubber [molds](molds.md) use an outer "mother mold" to support a more flexible rubber interior mold. By using a flexible interior mold material such as urethane rubber, objects with [undercuts](undercuts.md) that could not be molded with a [plaster](plaster.md) mold can be molded with less mold parts.
