Digital calipers are amazing [Tools](../making/tools.md) for measuring objects in the real world. They can measure depth, outside dimensions, interior dimensions and step dimensions. They are an indispensable tool for [3D-Modeling](../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md), design, engineering, machining and any other related field.

## Digital Caliper Tricks <!-- TODO make video about center to center hole measurements -->

- Measure center to center of threaded holes - First measure diameter of one of the fasteners. Then zero the calipers. Then put both fasteners solidly in the threaded holes. measure the outside distance of the fasteners. Since the calipers were zeroed with one fastener diameter, then it is automatically subtracted out and you get an accurate center to center distance.
