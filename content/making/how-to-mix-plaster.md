[Plaster](./plaster.md) can be mixed by the less precise volume or "volcano method" or the more precise mass method.

It is recommended to use the mass method unless you do not have access to a balance or scale. Using the mass method gives a much more consistent plaster mix than the volume method.

## Process

1. Calculate the volume of the space to fill with plaster.
2. Use a [plaster calculator](./plaster-calculator.md) to determine the amount of water and plaster needed for the calculated volume. A chart for common amounts of plaster is included below.
3. Record the plaster mix ratio and amounts in your notes so you can recall them in the future. It is important for all parts of the mold to have the same density / mix of plaster.
4. Add the correct amount of water to a bucket or other suitable container.
5. Make sure the water is not cold or hot. It should be lukewarm or room temperature or approximately 70°F or 21°C.
6. Plaster is always added to water. Do not add water to plaster or you will have a terrible mix with lots of inconsistent lumps of plaster that will likely ruin your cast form.
7. Slowly sift the plaster into the water. Do not dump the plaster. The goal is to have each particle of plaster to individually come into contact with the water to begin the hydration process. If large clumps of plaster are dumped into the water too quickly, then the plaster on the inside of the clump will not be fully hydrated and the mix will be bad.

## Troubleshooting

- Not fully mixed or hydrated plaster. A telltale sign of this is if there is standing water on the top of your plaster cast after pouring.
