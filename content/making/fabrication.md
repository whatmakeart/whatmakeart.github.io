Fabrication uses methods of attaching different [materials](materials-for-making.md) together such as screwing, glueing or [bolting](bolting.md).

Many different materials can be used in fabrication including metal, plastic, wood, soft foams, fabric, clay, carbon fiber and many more.

## Fabrication Design Principles

### Triangles are Strong

Triangles are strong, L's are lame,
squares are okay, and circles are amazing but hard to use.

### Common Types of Joints

- Butt Joints
- Lap Joints
- Mortise and Tenon Joints

## Fabrication Sequencing and Planning

From design to final output, fabrication processes have numerous steps, many that must be completed in sequence. In complex projects multiple fabricators working in different locations will make specific pieces of a design that will be assembled at yet another location. All fabrication projects from the most simple to the most complex benefit from proper planning.

The planning process begins with the initial concept and [sketching](../drawing/sketching.md). Before any idea or design is committed to, iterative sketching can find potential problems and suggest solutions before any fabrication occurs. As sketches become more refined a 3D Model can be made to test assumptions and to see if pieces will fit together. A list of [materials](materials-for-making.md) can be estimated from the 3d models and sketches.

It is important to start to think about not only the form of the object but how it will be made. What [order of operations](order-of-operations.md) is required to make the pieces accurately and efficiently? For example in [Woodworking](../woodworking/woodworking.md) it is usually a good idea to run a board through the [jointer](../woodworking/jointer.md) before sending it through the thickness [planer](../woodworking/planer.md) or to sand a wood surface before applying finisher. Each project will be unique and have different constraints on the fabrication process. Sometimes the [budget](../art-faq/how-to-create-an-artist-budget.md) Will not allow a material or tool to be used, sometimes the time available is not enough to get desired parts or equipment, sometimes a structural limitation of a site will dictate the use of lightweight materials.

## Fabrication Skills

- ability to make parts or prepare materials from basic drawings

## Metal Fabrication

[Welding](../metalworking/welding.md) used in [metal fabrication](../metalworking/metal-fabrication.md) is a special case of fabrication since it usually uses the same material as the pieces being joined together.

## Wood Fabrication

- [Wood-Fasteners](../woodworking/wood-fasteners.md)
- [Woodworking](../woodworking/woodworking.md)

## Digital Fabrication

[Digital fabrication](../digital-fabrication/digital-fabrication.md) uses [3D-Modeling](../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md) to create digital designs and then outputs the digital model to a physical form. Digital fabrication machines use gcode to translate the shape and size of the 3D model into a specific set of instructions or operations for the machine to execute. Stepper motors, linear rails, proximity sensors, computer vision and other industrial controls keep track of the precise location on the machine and material being fabricated.

### Fabrication Tools

[Jigs](jigs.md) hold material or parts in place while a fabrication process is completed. This can help with alignment of an assembly or to allow for repeatable actions to make multiple components to the same size and specification. Jigs are often unique and custom built depending on the project design.

### Digital Calipers

"Calipers may read to a resolution of 0.01 mm or 0.0005 in, but accuracy may not be better than about ±0.02 mm or 0.001 in for 150 mm (6 in) calipers, and worse for longer one." [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers#Comparison)
