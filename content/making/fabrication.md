Fabrication uses methods of attaching different materials together such as screwing, glueing or [Bolting](bolting.md).

Many different materials can be used in fabrication including metal, plastic, wood, soft foams, fabric, clay, carbon fiber and many more.

## Fabrication Design Principles

### Triangles are Strong

Triangles are strong, L's are lame and squares are okay, and circles are amazing but hard to use.

### Common Types of Joints

- Butt Joints
- Lap Joints
- Mortise and Tenon Joints

## Fabrication Sequencing and Planning

From design to final output, fabrication processes have numerous steps, many that must be completed in sequence. In complex projects multiple fabricators working in different locations will make specific pieces of a design that will be assembled at yet another location. All fabrication projects from the most simple to the most complex benefit from proper planning.

The planning process begins with the initial concept and [Sketching](../drawing/sketching.md). Before any idea or design is committed to, iterative sketching can find potential problems and suggest solutions before any fabrication occurs. As sketches become more refined a 3D Model can be made to test assumptions and to see if pieces will fit together. A list of materials can be estimated from the 3d models and sketches.

It is important to start to think about not only the form of the object but how it will be made. What [order of operations](../sculpture/order-of-operations.md) is required to make the pieces accurately and efficiently? For example in [Woodworking](../woodworking/woodworking.md) it is usually a good idea to run a board through the [jointer](../woodworking/jointer.md) before sending it through the thickness [planer](../woodworking/planer.md) or to sand a wood surface before applying finisher. Each project will be unique and have different constraints on the fabrication process. Sometimes the [budget](../art-faq/how-to-create-an-artist-budget.md) Will not allow a material or tool to be used, sometimes the time available is not enough to get desired parts or equipment, sometimes a structural limitation of a site will dictate the use of lightweight materials.

### Fact, Opinions, Guesses

The following framework of Facts, Opinions, and Guesses is a good way build in a safety factor into project estimates you use for planning and bidding jobs. Artists and Designers often get excited about new projects and are eager to get started. If this enthusiasm prevents one from objectively estimating and accounting for the resources required to complete a project, including time, money, materials, expertise, and equipment, it can be a costly mistake. Most things inevitably take longer than initially expected. Although sometimes projects finish early and under budget that is generally the exception to the rule.

Facts represent things that you have previously done and are knowledgeable about how long they took and cost. You have a previous time log or after project budget of a previous time you used the technique or material. Facts are distinguished from opinions because you have empirical data and experience to justify your estimate. When estimating a new project based on a "Fact" multiply the time you think it will take and how much it will cost by 1.5. This will give a slight buffer for contingencies.

Opinions represent things that you have not previously done and are not completely knowledgeable about how long they will take to complete and cost. The new process is not completely unknown to you since you have completed different but related work so you can form an educated opinion about how long the proposed project will take and how much it will cost. When estimating a new project based on a "Opinion" multiply the time you think it will take and how much it will cost by 2. This will give a reasonably sized buffer for the inevitable contingencies that you know will happen when trying something relatively new.

Guesses represent things that you have not previously done and are not knowledgeable at all about how long they will take to complete and cost. The new process is completely unknown to you since you have no experience with it and must learn a new, process, material or tool that you do not have relevant related experience. Before even making an estimate you will likely need to do research and potentially small test projects to get enough information to make a guess estimate When estimating a new project based on a "Guess" multiply the time you think it will take and how much it will cost by 3. This will hopefully give a big enough buffer for the inevitable contingencies that you know will happen and for the problem you do not know will happen when trying something completely new.

## Metal Fabrication

[Welding](../metalworking/welding.md) used in [metal fabrication](../metalworking/metal-fabrication.md) is a special case of fabrication since it usually uses the same material as the pieces being joined together.

## Wood Fabrication

[Wood-Fasteners](../woodworking/wood-fasteners.md) [Woodworking](../woodworking/woodworking.md)

## Digital Fabrication

Digital fabrication uses [3D-Modeling](../3d-modeling/3d-modeling.md) to create digital designs and then outputs the digital model to a physical form. Digital fabrication machines use gcode to translate the shape and size of the 3D model into a specific set of instructions or operations for the machine to execute. Stepper motors, linear rails, proximity sensors, computer vision and other industrial controls keep track of the precise location on the machine and material being fabricated.

### Types of Digital Fabrication

[Laser-Cutting](../digital-fabrication/laser-cutting.md) uses a high powered laser to cut through wood, metal and plastic. A laser cutter can also etch designs and images. [CNC](../digital-fabrication/cnc.md) Machining uses spinning cutters that move along a precise coordinate system.  
[3D-Printing](../digital-fabrication/3d-printing.md) builds up an object layer by layer. [Vinyl Cutting](../digital-fabrication/vinyl-cutting.md) cuts rolls of vinyl based on vector graphic input. [Water Jet Cutting](../digital-fabrication/water-jet-cutting.md) uses high powered streams of water carrying abrasive particles to cut through a wide variety of materials.

### Fabrication Tools

[Jigs](jigs.md) hold material or parts in place while a fabrication process is completed. This can help with alignment of an assembly or to allow for repeatable actions to make multiple components to the same size and specification. Jigs are often unique and custom built depending on the project design.

### Digital Calipers

"Calipers may read to a resolution of 0.01 mm or 0.0005 in, but accuracy may not be better than about Â±0.02 mm or 0.001 in for 150 mm (6 in) calipers, and worse for longer one." [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers#Comparison)
