Digital fabrication uses the output from files and models created with a computer to control machines that cut, create, and form objects in the real world. The digital information directly controls the machine with little to no human intervention. This is different from traditional fabrication where a human uses tools to cut, join, and form materials regardless of the use of jigs or fixtures to make the work more precise. If a human is moving the tool it is analog [fabrication](../making/fabrication.md) and if a machine is controlled by digital information then it is digital fabrication.

Digital fabrication can be broken into three main processes, additive, subtractive, and forming. Types of digital fabrication include:

- [Laser-Cutting](./laser-cutting/laser-cutting.md) uses a high powered laser to cut through wood, metal and plastic. A laser cutter can also etch designs and images.
- [CNC](./cnc/cnc-basics.md) Machining uses spinning cutters that move along a precise coordinate system.
- [3D-Printing](./3d-printing/3d-printing.md) builds up an object layer by layer. Vinyl Cutting cuts rolls of vinyl based on vector graphic input.
- [Water Jet Cutting](./water-jet-cutting.md) uses high powered streams of water carrying abrasive particles to cut through a wide variety of materials.
- [Vinyl Cutting](./vinyl-cutting-basics.md)
