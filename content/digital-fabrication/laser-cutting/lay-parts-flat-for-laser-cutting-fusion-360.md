Once your model is complete and each piece is a separate and labeled component, you are ready to lay your pieces flat to create a DXF toolpath file for the laser cutter.

1. Change to the Manufacture Workspace.
2. Make sure you created a Manufacture Model. This model is like a linked copy of your Design Model. It allows you to lay your pieces flat with out moving your Design Model. This video shows [how to make a Manufacture Model](https://youtu.be/bhVPR4CUOUk).
3. Draw a sketch to represent your plywood or acrylic sheet. Make the dimensions of the sketch the size of your material. If you are using larger plywood or acrylic then draw a larger sketch. If you are using a "remnant" or cutoff piece then draw your sketch to that size.
4. Then use the Arrange command to lay your parts flat.
5. Follow the instructions in [the video](https://youtu.be/jeQPJHHwVN4) to arrange your parts flat.
