Laser cutting is a precise method of cutting a design from a material using a digital file as a guide. It uses a high-powered laser to slice materials such as wood, plastic, glass, metal, and paper into custom shapes and designs.

## Create Laser Cut Design with Fusion 360

1. Sketch out design ideas on paper or digital sketchbook
2. Selecting 3D Modeling software, ideally a [parametric modeling](../../3d-modeling/parametric-modeling.md) program such as [Fusion 360](../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/fusion-360.md)
3. Model the parts of your design paying attention to joints, where pieces meet, and how thick the material is. [User parameters](../../3d-modeling/fusion-360/basic-user-parameters-fusion-360.md) act as variables and allow the model to change based on user input
4. Lay all of the parts flat
5. Prepare a tool path that takes into account the width or kerf of the laser
6. Export a DXF file for cutting
7. Prepare the DXF file according to the instructions of a particular laser cutter.
