For the purposes of this [safety](../making/safety.md) guide, high voltage means anything above 40-50 volts. When working on electronics it is common to encounter DC voltages from 3.3 volts, to 24 volts as well as AC mains voltages of 110 - 220 volts. Any higher voltages should be avoided without specific training.

- Always de-energize equipment before working on it.
- Always follow basic [electricity-safety](electricity-safety.md)

## Very High Voltage Safety

> Very high voltage electricity, anything above 110-220 volts, is extremely dangerous and can cause serious injury or death, even from a small shock. It is important to take all necessary safety precautions when working with or around very high voltage equipment. If you are not qualified to work on high voltage equipment, then leave the job to a professional. High voltage electricity is too dangerous to risk working on if you are not properly trained and equipped.
