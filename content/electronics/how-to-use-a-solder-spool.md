## How to Load a Solder Spool with New Solder

In this video, I will show you how to load a solder spool with new solder. This is a quick and easy process that can be done in just a few minutes.

## What You Will Need

- A solder dispenser
- A new solder spool
- A dowel rod

## Instructions

1. Remove the old solder spool from the dispenser.
2. Insert the dowel rod into the new solder spool.
3. Thread the solder onto the dowel rod, making sure that it is going over the top of the spool.
4. Slide the dowel rod back into the guide holes on the spool until it snaps in place.
5. Make sure that the solder is under the handle of the dispenser.
6. Move the handle back and put the solder through the guide.
7. Make sure that the solder is not going over the edges of the spool.
8. You are now ready to start using your new solder spool.

## Tips

- When choosing a solder spool, make sure that it is the correct size for your dispenser.
- If you are using a solder spool with a small diameter, you may need to use a smaller dowel rod.
- Be careful not to overfill the spool with solder.

## Benefits of Using a Solder Dispenser

- Solder dispensers are a great way to keep your solder organized and easy to use.
- They can help to prevent solder from getting tangled or lost.
- Solder dispensers can also help to improve the accuracy of your soldering.
