## Potential Research Sources

- Your faculty and other local experts are a great resource. Don't hesitate to ask them questions and for help. They will not do your work for you but they are there to help you in any way they can.
- Search Engines - Dig deep and go past the initial search results and advertisements. Once you read some information you will gain better search terms to continue research. For example: IF you start researching motors you might learn that there are AC and DC motors. Then you might learn there are different types of motors, brushed, brushless, stepper, servo, synchronous, and more. Researching more about stepper motors and you might discover the concept of motor drivers or control boards. BZy continuing to add additional search terms you will continue to gain new knowledge such as rotary encoders and motor control.
- Online Communities and Forums
  - There are many electronics related subreddits that you can search and **ask** questions in. Some communities have more members and are more active than others. Read some posts and then **post questions**. This can't be stressed enough and is a great way to learn.

  - The [Official Arduino Forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/) is a great place to search, read, and **ask questions**. (Do you see a trend? Asking questions is very important.)
    - [Overview Arduino Forum Post with Links to Helpful Topics](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/useful-links-check-here-for-reference-posts-tutorials/370268)
    - [Arduino Forum Post about Project Starting Tips](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/planning-and-implementing-an-arduino-program/252364)
  - The [All About Circuits Forum](https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/) is not Arduino specific but is frequented by many experts that are often ready to help.
  - The [EEVBlog Forum](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/index.php) is active with DIY electronics enthusiasts.
  - [Electro Tech Online](https://www.electro-tech-online.com/) is another relatively active forum.
  - Don't forget to use the search feature of the forums in addition to asking questions. Often your exact question or a question very similar may have already been asked. When this happens it saves a lot of time because the answer is sitting there waiting for you.
- The library has lots of basic electronics and circuitry books. These are a wealth of information and are great to flip through to gain information, insight, and inspiration.
- The [think[box]](https://case.edu/thinkbox/equipment/electronics) has experts in electronics that are there to help you with your projects.
