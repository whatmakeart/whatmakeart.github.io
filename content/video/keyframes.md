title: Keyframes
---

Keyframes describe an attribute at a point in time. This could be position, scale, rotation, opacity or many other parameters. With only a single keyframe, nothing happens. If a second keyframe is set at a different point in time and has a different value for that same attribute as the first keyframe, then software can "tween" or animate the transition from one keyframe value to another keyframe value.

How far apart the keyframes are on the timeline determines the speed of the change. This can also be changed by changing the type of the keyframe to influence its interpolation.
