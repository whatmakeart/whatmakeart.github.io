In this quick tutorial, I'll show you how to create a simple but effective fire effect using just a few basic steps. No need for After Effects or any other complex software.

Here's what you'll need:

- A video clip of your finger
- A fire video clip
- Some sound effects

## Steps

1. Import your media into Premiere Pro.
2. Determine where the finger starts on fire and where it extinguishes.
3. Import the fire video clip and trim it to the desired length.
4. Use the Luma Key effect to remove the black background from the fire video clip.
5. Nest the fire video clip and finger video clip together.
6. Position and scale the fire video clip over the finger video clip.
7. Keyframe the position of the fire video clip to make it wave around.
8. Add sound effects to make the effect more realistic.
9. Adjust the blending modes and opacity of the fire video clip to get the desired look.

## Additional tips:

- Use a high-quality fire video clip for the best results.
- Experiment with different blending modes and opacity settings to find the look that you like best.
- Add other effects, such as blur or color correction, to further enhance the effect.
