In this video tutorial, I'll show you how to start a new project and import video footage into your project in [Adobe Premiere Pro](adobe-premiere.md). I'll cover two ways to import video:

1. **The streamlined process:** This is a quick and easy way to import video if you already know what you want to import.
2. **The manual process:** This can be a more flexible way to import video if you want to control where the video is imported and how it's organized.

## Steps Using Streamlined Process

1. Open Premiere Pro.
2. Create a new project.
3. Navigate to your video files.
4. Select the checkbox of the video files you want to import.
5. Click **Import**.
6. Choose the options you want for importing the video such as creating a bin or labeling the speakers
7. Click **Create**.

## Manually Importing Media

There are two ways to manually import video footage into Premiere Pro. First make a new project and open the project.

- Using the Import Media Button
  1. Click the **Import Media** button in the lower left corner of the Project window.
  2. Navigate to the folder where your video footage is located.
  3. Select the videos you want to import.
  4. Click **Open**.
- Using the File Menu
  1. Click **File** > **Import**.
  2. Select the videos you want to import.
  3. Click **Open**.

## Organize Your Video Footage

Once you have imported your video footage, you can organize it by creating bins. Bins are folders that you can use to store your media files.

1. To create a bin, click the **New Bin** button in the Project window.
2. Give the bin a name.
3. Drag the video footage you want to organize into the bin.

## Import Audio Files

You can also import audio files into Premiere Pro. The process is the same as importing video footage.

## Start Editing

Now that you have imported your video and audio footage, you can start editing your project.

### Tips

- Make sure your video files are compatible with Premiere Pro.
- If you're importing a lot of video files, consider using the **Import Media** button in the Project panel.
- You can also import video by dragging and dropping it into the Project panel.
- If you're importing video from a different location, you can choose to copy the media or link to the original files.
- You can also choose to create a new sequence when you import the video.
