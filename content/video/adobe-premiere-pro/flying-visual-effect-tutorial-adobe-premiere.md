In this Adobe Premiere Pro tutorial, I will show you how to create the illusion of flying using simple editing techniques. We will start by creating a green screen background, then add a video of yourself jumping up into the air. Using the Ultra Key effect, we will remove the green screen and make it look like you are flying through the air. We will also add a shadow to make the effect more realistic. Finally, we will add some motion blur to give the illusion of speed.

## Steps

1. Create a green screen background.
2. Add a video of yourself jumping up into the air.
3. Use the Ultra Key effect to remove the green screen.
4. Add a shadow to make the effect more realistic.
5. Add some motion blur to give the illusion of speed.

## Tips

- Make sure the green screen is evenly lit.
- Use a high-quality video of yourself jumping up into the air.
- Adjust the settings of the Ultra Key effect to get a good key.
- Position the shadow so that it looks realistic.
- Experiment with the amount of motion blur to find what looks best.
