In this Adobe Premiere Pro tutorial, learn how to use multiple instances of the Ultra Key green screen effect to key out different colors of green. This is useful for situations where you have a green screen with multiple colors, or where the green screen is not perfectly even.

The first step is to create two instances of the Ultra Key effect on the same clip. Then, use the mask tool to mask out the different parts of the green screen that you want to key out. For example, you could mask out the bottom piece of fabric in the green screen, or the background behind the subject. Once you have masked out the different parts of the green screen, you can adjust the settings for each instance of the Ultra Key effect. This includes settings such as the pedestal, shadows, highlights, contrast, and midpoint. Finally, you can use the opacity mask to fine-tune the key. This is useful for removing any small areas of the green screen that were not keyed out by the Ultra Key effect.

By following these steps, you can use multiple instances of the Ultra Key effect to create a near perfect green screen key, even in cases where the green screen is not perfectly even.

## Steps

1. Add an instance of Ultra Key to your green screen footage.
2. Use the Ultra Key pen tool to mask out any areas of the green screen that you do not want to be keyed out.
3. Duplicate the Ultra Key effect.
4. Reset the second instance of Ultra Key so that it is not affecting any of the masked areas.
5. Use the eyedropper tool to select the color of the green screen that you want to key out.
6. Adjust the settings of the second instance of Ultra Key until you get a good key.
7. Use the opacity mask to fine-tune the key.

### Tips for using multiple instances of the Ultra Key effect:

- Use different names for each instance of the Ultra Key effect so that you can easily keep track of them.
- Use the opacity mask to fine-tune the key, especially around the edges of the subject.
- Key out the background first, then the foreground objects. This will help to prevent the Ultra Key effect from accidentally keying out parts of the foreground objects.
- Use the pedestal setting in the Ultra Key effect to remove noise from the background.
- Use the shadows and highlights settings to adjust the brightness of the keyed areas.
- Use the contrast setting to make the keyed areas more distinct.
- Use the midpoint setting to adjust the color of the keyed areas.
- Use the tolerance setting to control how close the colors need to be to be keyed out.
