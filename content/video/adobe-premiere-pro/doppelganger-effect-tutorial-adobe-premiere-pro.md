In this video tutorial, I will show you how to create a doppelganger effect in Adobe Premiere Pro. This effect can be used to make it look like there are two of you in the same scene.

To create this effect, you will need to film yourself coming in from one side of the screen and then again from the other side. You will also need to use a tripod to keep the camera steady.

Once you have filmed your footage, you will need to import it into Premiere Pro. Then, you will need to create a mask for one of the clips. This will allow you to hide the actor that you don't want to show.

You can then adjust the opacity of the mask to blend the two clips together. You can also add feather to the mask to make the transition smoother.

Finally, you can add some close-up shots to heighten the drama.
