Animation can be broadly separated into to categories: 2D Animation and 3D Animation.

## 2D Animation

2D Animation can be as simple as a "flip book" on the edges of the pages of a book or use software to do the work of adding [keyframes](./keyframes.md) in between poses in the animation.

## 3D Animation

3D animation is accomplished with 3D modeling software such as [Blender](../3d-modeling/blender/blender.md) or [Maya](../3d-modeling/maya/maya.md)
