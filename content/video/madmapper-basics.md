To get started with projection mapping with MadMapper, you will need:

- MadMapper software
- A computer, with video out and cables to connect to the projector
- A projector, preferably a short throw projector
- An adjustable projector mount is helpful for aligning the projection
- Video content, generated animations, or images
- A surface to project on

## Setting Up Computer and Projector for Madmapper

1. Connect the projector to the computer with an HDMI cable or other video cable.
2. Cover the entire surface / object to be mapped with the projector image.
3. Make sure that the projector acts as a separate display.
4. On a Mac computer, make sure the menu bar is on the laptop screen in System Preferences, and that "mirror displays" is unchecked.
5. On a Windows computer, select "extend these displays"
6. In Madmapper, click on the projector button and set the projector output as the projector, not your computer monitor. In this menu you can rename the projector and change its resolution.

## Setting up a Mapping

1. Click on the Suface button on the top left.
2. Select a quad and adjust the size and position of the quad to match a surface that you are projecting on.
