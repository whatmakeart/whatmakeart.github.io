## What is a Narrative Arc?

A traditional story arc contains an introduction of the story, plot, characters and setting. This is called the Exposition. This leads into the Rising Action when the character is faced with a problem. The character then confronts obstacles along the way toward the Climax of the story, a moment of crisis that directs the rest of the plot. This is followed by Falling Action as the plot moves from climax to the ending. Finally a Resolution occurs and stability returns to the story.

- **Exposition** – intro of plot, characters and setting
- **Rising Action** – multiple incidents occur providing suspense and tension
- **Climax** – moment of crisis that directs the rest of the plot
- **Falling Action** – plot moves from climax to ending
- **Resolution** – final results of plot - stability returns

## How to Make a Narrative Arc?

When composing a narrative it is a good idea to spend a few minutes to write a brief Story Spine that follows a narrative arc. Remember that narratives do not have to have any narrative structure but they often do. A narrative can also be an abstract visual experience. Nevertheless any sequence of images will tend to have some structure even if that structure is to intentionally disregard structure. Think of a story structure as having 3 parts.

### Part 1

Explain the setting of the animation. Where is it? What is seen? What is happening? What is the subject?

### Part 2

Introduce a problem, conflict or goal. Where is the character going? What do they want to do? Is everything exploding and on fire? Or is is a tranquil and peaceful setting where the problem is that the protagonist is bored?

### Part 3

Resolve part 2. What is the result of the actions of the character after encountering part 2? How does the subject escape the fire or stop being bored?

## What is a Story Spine?

A [Story Spine](story-spine.md) is simple method to break a story down into 9 parts that then are split into three groups to make a 3 part narrative arc.

After this diction is made that there is often no going back.
