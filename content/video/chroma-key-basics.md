Chroma keying is a visual effects technique that allows you to replace the background of a video shot with another image or video. It is most commonly used to create the illusion of people or objects being in places where they are not, such as a newscaster standing in front of a world map or a superhero [flying through the air](./adobe-premiere-pro/flying-visual-effect-tutorial-adobe-premiere.md).

Chroma keying works by using a solid-colored background, usually green or blue, to isolate the subject of the shot. The video editing software is then able to identify and remove the background color, revealing the transparency behind it, creating an alpha channel. This allows you to replace the background with any other image or video you want.

### After Effects Chroma Keying

After Effects has more robust chroma keying tools than Adobe Premiere.

### Premiere Chroma Keying

The chroma keying tools in Premiere are simple to use and produce good results but have limitations for more complex keying workflows.
