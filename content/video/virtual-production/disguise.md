Proposed Agenda

1. Studio task workflow

- How are tasks determined and tracked?
  - Email request?
  - Spreadsheet list?
  - Paper near 212 office?
- How are tasks prioratized?

2. How can we efficiently identify tasks, prioratize completion?

For example a series of things that could be done which everyone would likely rate at a different priority level:

- Fabricating sturdy broom holders and hanging up
- organizing and cleaning scrap fabric piles
- making tool holders for serger maintanence tools
- fabricating 5 scisors holders for the tool boards
- sorting out the SEM network connectivity
- making the computer stations functional
- building metal hammer holders
- fabricading sliding slots for small parts bins
- building and organising a general tool station to replace desk and bins in 212
- replacement of stacked desks in hall with more usable solution
- organize and rearrange storage area for wool and fabric
