The [Ki Pro Ultra 12G](https://www.aja.com/products/ki-pro-ultra-12g) records onto AJA SSD Pak Media drives. These must be properly mounted and unmounted before removal to use in a Pak Dock to transfer media to editing hardware.

The `SLOT` button on the front panel selects which media slot the Ki Pro recorders to. It is also used to mount or unmount the selected media drive. If you press the `SLOT` button it will switch between unmounting the media and selecting the media drive. Only remove the PAK card if the LED is off. Failure to wait for the light to turn off can result in lost media and or damage to the PAK drive.
