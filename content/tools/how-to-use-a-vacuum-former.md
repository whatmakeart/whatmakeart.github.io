### Belovac Vacuum Former Instructions

1. Make sure your mold is clean and dry and made of a materials able to withstand the vacuum forming process. Ensure there are no undercuts in your mold and it is the desired smoothness.
2. Cut your plastic sheet to the desired size. The sheet should be slightly larger than your mold and match the tooling used.
3. Raise the clamp and place the plastic sheet on the tooling table and clamp it in place.
4. Turn on the heater and set the desired temperature. The temperature will vary depending on the type of plastic you are using. Consult the manufacturer's instructions for specific recommendations.
5. Move the heater panel over the plastic sheet.
6. Heat the plastic sheet until it is soft and has some give.
7. Raise the mold onto the plastic sheet. This creates a seal around the edges of the plastic and the mold.
8. The vacuum pump will draw the plastic sheet around the mold.
9. Allow the plastic to cool and harden in the mold.
10. Lower the mold and remove the finished part.
11. Repeat to make more parts
