A heat gun is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, including removing paint, shrinking tubing, bending plastic, and soldering. It is important to use a heat gun safely and correctly to avoid injury or damage to your workspace.

## Heat Gun Safety

- Wear safety glasses and gloves when using a heat gun.
- Be careful not to touch the hot nozzle of the heat gun.
- Do not work in a dusty or flammable environment.
- Keep the heat gun moving to avoid overheating the surface you are working on.

## Heat Gun Instructions

1. Select the appropriate temperature setting for the task at hand. Consult the heat gun manual for specific recommendations.
2. Plug in the heat gun and turn it on.
3. Hold the heat gun about 2 inches away from the surface you are working on, or more for fragile materials.
4. Move the heat gun in a continuous, sweeping motion.
5. If the surface does not heat up enough, move the heat gun closer or sweep slower.
6. Be careful not to overheat the surface, as this can cause damage.
7. Once the surface has reached the desired temperature, you can begin your task.
8. If necessary, adjust the temperature setting or distance to achieve the desired results.
9. Once you are finished, turn off the heat gun and unplug it.

## Common Heat Gun Uses

- **Removing paint:** Use a heat gun to soften old paint, making it easier to scrape off. Be careful not to burn or char the paint.
- **Shrinking tubing:** [Heat shrink tubing](../electronics/heat-shrink-tubing.md) is a type of plastic tubing that shrinks when heated. This can be used to insulate electrical wires or to create a watertight seal.
- **Bending plastic:** Heat can be used to soften plastic, making it easier to bend. This can be useful for creating custom parts or for repairing damaged plastic items. Compressed air inside can be used to [bend pvc pipe](../making/bend-pvc-pipe.md) without the bends deforming or collapsing.
- **Drying wet surfaces**: Heat guns can be used to dry wet surfaces quickly and efficiently.

### Tips

- Always test the heat gun on a scrap piece of material before using it on the actual project. This will help you to determine the appropriate temperature setting and distance.
- Use the lowest heat setting possible for the task you are performing.
- Be patient. It may take some time for the surface to heat up.
- Be careful not to overheat the surface, as this can cause damage.
- If you are using the heat gun to remove paint, be sure to work in a well-ventilated area and wear an appropriate respirator.

If you are unsure about how to use a heat gun for a particular task, consult the manufacturer's instructions.
