## Supplies Needed

- Pop rivet gun
- Pop rivets (correct size for the job)
- Drill bit (same diameter as the rivet shank)
- Drill
- Materials to join
- Safety glasses

## Pop Rivet Gun Instructions

1. Pop rivets come in different sizes and materials, so make sure you choose the right one for your job. Consider the thickness of the materials you are joining and the strength required. The rivet shank should be slightly longer than the materials you are joining, and the rivet head should be large enough to cover the hole.
2. Drill a hole through the materials you are joining. The hole should be the same diameter as the rivet shank.
3. Insert the rivet into the rivet gun. The mandrel (the long metal pin) should go into the collet of the rivet gun first.
4. Place the rivet into the hole. Make sure that the rivet head is flush with the surface of the material.
5. Squeeze the trigger of the rivet gun. This will pull the mandrel through the rivet, which will expand the rivet head and secure the materials together.
6. Continue squeezing the handel until the mandrel breaks off. Then the rivet head will be flush with the surface of the material.

### Tips

- If you are using a manual rivet gun, you may need to squeeze the trigger several times to set the rivet.
- If you are using a power rivet gun, be careful not to over-squeeze the trigger, as this can damage the rivet.
- If you make a mistake, you can remove the rivet by drilling through the head of the rivet.

## Pop Rivet Gun Safety Precautions

- Always wear safety glasses when using a rivet gun.
- Be careful not to over-squeeze the trigger, as this can damage the rivet or cause the rivet gun to malfunction.
- Be aware of your surroundings and make sure that there are no people or objects in the way of the rivet gun.

## Pop Rivet Example

You are attaching a piece of sheet metal to a wooden frame. You would first drill a hole through both pieces of material, using a drill bit the same diameter as the rivet shank. Then, you would insert a pop rivet into the rivet gun and place it into the hole. Finally, you would squeeze the trigger of the rivet gun to set the rivet. Ideally the less compressible material will be placed so the expanded rivet shank compresses against this material while the flange of the rivet head is flush against the softer material.

Pop rivet guns are a versatile and easy-to-use tool for joining a variety of materials.
