Sometimes working in Autodesk Maya the Move tool cursor is super huge. Why does this happen? How can you make the move tool cursor smaller on the screen so you can grab the handles and move your 3D model? This tutorial shows you how.

## Transcript

Maya tutorial I‚Äôm going to show you how to fix your cursor when it's super long and you can't see the edges.

If you look at this model right here if I orbit around look how long these pieces are I can still use them if I click way on the edges or I get lucky and click these lines but it can be really annoying especially if I‚Äôm trying to move and I want to use the planar moves which I can't see because they're way far away so it can be very difficult to use. This happens accidentally all the time just because you're pressing different keys on the keyboard.

You use the plus and minus keys to change the size of this orbit tool. So here now I can use the planar tools that weren't available before. So, if you accidentally make it super small this can be great for when you're doing detail work and you want it nice and small and then you can make it very large by pressing the plus button.

So, in Autodesk Maya you can change the size of your cursor and your transform controls by using the plus and minus tools. Hopefully this helps you model and make 3D characters much quicker and faster and with less annoying things when you're modeling in Autodesk Maya.

Happy 3D modeling.
