{{< youtube id="DUKkJSpCJ8A" title="Blender Fluid Simulation Basics" >}}

In this video, we will show you how to create a basic fluid simulation in Blender. We will use just three objects: a coffee cup, a sphere, and a domain. We will then show you how to set up the simulation and bake it. Finally, we will show you how to add materials and an HDRI image to make your simulation look more realistic.

## What You Will Need

- Blender
- A coffee cup model
- A sphere model
- An HDRI image

## Steps

1. Create a new scene in Blender.
2. Add a coffee cup model to the scene.
3. Add a sphere model to the scene.
4. Add a domain object to the scene.
5. Set the domain object to liquid.
6. Set the sphere object to flow.
7. Bake the simulation.
8. Add materials to the objects.
9. Add an HDRI image to the scene.

## Tips

- Use a high-resolution domain object for better results.
- Use a high-resolution sphere object for better results.
- Use a high-quality HDRI image for better results.

## Conclusion

In this video, we showed you how to create a basic fluid simulation in Blender. We hope you found this video helpful. Please let us know if you have any questions.
