## How to Combine Two Arduino Sketches

In this Arduino tutorial, I will show you how to combine two Arduino sketches into one single program. This is a useful skill to know if you want to reuse code from existing sketches or if you want to combine two sketches that do different things.

To combine two Arduino sketches, you will need to:

1. Open both sketches in the Arduino IDE.
2. Copy the contents of the first sketch.
3. Paste the contents of the first sketch into the second sketch.
4. Make sure that there are no duplicate variable names or pin numbers.
5. Compile and upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

Here are some tips for combining Arduino sketches:

- Use descriptive variable names to make your code easier to read and understand.
- Use comments to explain what your code is doing.
- Use functions to organize your code and make it easier to reuse.
- Test your code thoroughly before uploading it to your Arduino board.
