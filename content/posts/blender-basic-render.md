## How to Create a Simple Render in Blender

In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create a simple render of a cube with a backdrop and two lights.

### Step 1: Create a Cube and a Backdrop

The first thing you need to do is create a cube and a backdrop. To do this, go to **Add > Mesh > Cube** and then go to **Add > Mesh > Plane**.

### Step 2: Position the Cube and Backdrop

Now, you need to position the cube and backdrop. To do this, move the cube up to the top level of the grid and then scale the backdrop up so that it is larger than the cube.

### Step 3: Add Lights

Now, you need to add two lights to the scene. To do this, go to **Add > Light > Point Light** and then duplicate the light by pressing **Shift + D**.

### Step 4: Adjust the Light Settings

Now, you need to adjust the settings of the lights. To do this, select the lights and then go to the **Properties Editor**. In the **Properties Editor**, you can adjust the color, intensity, and falloff of the lights.

### Step 5: Render the Scene

Once you are happy with the lighting, you can render the scene. To do this, go to **Render > Render Image**.

### That's it! You have now successfully created a simple render of a cube with a backdrop and two lights.\*\*

**Here are some additional tips:**

- You can use different materials to create different looks for your objects.
- You can use different render engines to create different types of images.
- You can use Blender to create a variety of different 3D objects and scenes.
