This tutorial will show how to make drawings to scale. Make scale drawings, or drawings that are a different size than what they depict, but accurately represent the proportional sizes of all the components. The ability to make accurate scale drawings is an essential sculpture and making skill.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial you should be familiar with:

- [How to Use Measuring Tools Accurately](../making/how-to-use-measuring-tools-accurately.md)
- Basic [Drawing-Tools](./drawing-tools.md)
- [Technical Drawing Tools](./technical-drawing-tools.md)

## Instructions

1. The first step is to decide if you are scaling up the drawing or scaling down the drawing.
2. Select a scale appropriate for the size of objects and the size of your drawing medium.
3. Graph paper can help with grid layouts but is not necessary.
4. Start sketching out the main elements of the object lightly and check the measurements against the real object and the converted scale measurement.
