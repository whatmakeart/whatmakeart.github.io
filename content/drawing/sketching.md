Sketching is a great process for visualizing ideas and refining your ideas before committing to making. Pencils and paper are relatively cheap and with practice it only takes a few minutes to sketch out an idea in order to begin to evaluate it.

Once you sketch out multiple ideas, then you can compare and edit them through a constant process of improvement. Detailed sketches can explore different parts of an idea or concept before making three dimensional mockups either in a computer or with analog means such as [Paper-Maché](../making/paper-maché.md) or cardboard.

## Ideation Sketching

[Ideation sketching](ideation-sketches.md) is a form of sketching that explores a variety of possible creative ideas. It should get ideas out of the creator's mind and into a tangible form quickly.

## Technical Sketching

Why do we use sketches? Sketches are a very efficient way to communicate. We have all heard the cliche that a picture is worth a thousand words. This is even more so in [technical sketching](technical-sketching.md).
