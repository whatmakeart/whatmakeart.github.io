Sketching is a great process for visualizing ideas and refining your ideas before committing to making. Pencils and paper are relatively cheap and with practice it only takes a few minutes to sketch out an idea in order to begin to evaluate it.

Once you sketch out multiple ideas, then you can compare and edit them through a constant process of improvement. Detailed sketches can explore different parts of an idea or concept before making three dimensional mockups either in a computer or with analog means such as [Paper-Mach√©](../sculpture/paper-mach%C3%A9.md) or cardboard.

## Ideation Sketching

[Ideation sketching](ideation-sketches.md) is a form of sketching that explores a variety of possible creative ideas. It should get ideas out of the creator's mind and into a tangible form quickly.

### Idea Generation vs Idea Iteration

### Introduction to Technical Sketching

We need to be able to communicate our complex ideas of three-dimensional forms in a simple visual way. I can go sketching achieve this. There are two types of technical sketching two-dimensional sketching and three-dimensional sketching. 3D sketching really helps one visualize how a part or a design will exist in the physical world. 2D sketching can show how a part would be manufactured in gift precise details such as dimensions and other information.

Why do we use sketches? Sketches are a very efficient way to communicate. We have all heard the cliche that a picture is worth a thousand words This is even more so in technical sketching. Take for instance a 4 inch cube that is easy enough to describe with words. Now we need to edit this cube and we could still describe it with words with a corner cut out. What if we chamfer all the edges still not so bad now let's add some holes and a convex shape to this. What if we also have some rounded forms on the edge. Now this starts to become more complex and the sketches are more efficient than using words and more precise and repeatable

Everything that we do with the computer today can be done with a couple triangles a t-square and a compass and protractor.

Although you do not need become an expert in hand drafting to be successful in 3D design you do need to know the concepts of sketching two-dimensional and three-dimensional designs We can clean up our hand drawn designs and sketches in a computer for very precise modeling. Just because the computer can do things doesn't mean that you don't need to understand the concepts and skills of technical sketching. We will use our hands to quickly draw all the conceptual elements of a technical sketch and then we will put this information into a computer to model our designs and then output precise computer generated technical sketches as needed

There are a few different types of three-dimensional technical sketches we have isometric sketches oblique sketches and perspective sketches. For the most part we will be using isometric sketches sometimes we will have prospective sketches to make a conceptual visualization but they are less useful for actual technical sketching. Two dimensional sketching we will use multi-view sketches that show the top side and front of an object. These will be lined up in playing with each other so that we can see how the different size relate to each other along with hidden elements shown by dotted lines.
