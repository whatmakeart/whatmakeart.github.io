Sketching is a great process for visualizing ideas and refining your ideas before committing to making. Pencils and paper are relatively cheap and with practice it only takes a few minutes to sketch out an idea in order to begin to evaluate it.

Once you sketch out multiple ideas, then you can compare and edit them through a constant process of improvement. Detailed sketches can explore different parts of an idea or concept before making three dimensional mockups either in a computer or with analog means such as [Paper-Mach√©](../sculpture/paper-mach%C3%A9.md) or cardboard.

## Ideation Sketching

[Ideation sketching](ideation-sketches.md) is a form of sketching that explores a variety of possible creative ideas. It should get ideas out of the creator's mind and into a tangible form quickly.

### Idea Generation vs Idea Iteration

Idea generation is creating as many different ideas as possible. The ideas and concept should vary widely and have diverse approaches. Many of these ideas will be terrible but it is not a time to censor thought. Just get everything down on the proverbial page.

Idea iteration is selection a potentially promising idea from the idea generation phase and making many different versions of that particular idea. The version can be big changes or slight tweaks. After a few versions or "iterations" then you should examine the results and make further changes and iterations based on the results so far.

## Technical Sketching

Why do we use sketches? Sketches are a very efficient way to communicate. We have all heard the cliche that a picture is worth a thousand words. This is even more so in [technical sketching](./technical-sketching.md).
