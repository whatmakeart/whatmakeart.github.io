What? Make Art is a repository of open access college art [course materials](./courses/_index.md), art making videos, tutorials and [art making faq's](./art-faq/_index.md). Tutorials cover a wide range of topics including making, electronic art, digital art, Photoshop, Technical Drawing, Illustrator, After Effects, Adobe Premiere, 3d Modeling, 3d Printing, Animation, Maya, Fusion 360 and more.

Art making tutorial videos start from a beginner level an progress to more advanced topics.

What? Make Art aims to share knowledge about the creative process and how to go about making art to the world. The project was created by[Jimmy Kuehnle](https://www.jimmykuehnle.com), an artist and educator.

Just the tutorials about making art. Visit on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmGXH-jy0o2CuhqtpxbaQgA).

## Whatmakeart Open Making Wiki Project Introduction

This is a conceptual work in progress exploring better ways to exchange information, concepts and skills about artistic making with students, artists and the public. The primary audience are enrolled students in college art courses but limiting the resource to this audience would stifle growth, creativity and innovation. Therefore the goal is the engage and collaborate with the world.

### Goals

- Easily accessible sculpture making information online
- Improve the education of sculpture students
- remove friction such as passwords and logins to access information
- continually update and improve sculpture information

## Public vs Private vs Hybrid?

#### University of Washington Computer Science Courses

These "open" course pages have been available for years and are a model of what I think should be done at a minimum. An LMS such as Canvas or Blackboard could be used to make course content public but then why not just publish the material on the web so it is more likely to be longer lasting

## Art Wiki

### Public?

Ideally the wiki will be 100% publicly accessible. The goal is to build knowledge that is useful for students and artists and then to share that information with the world. By sharing the information more eyes will see it increasing the change of interaction, collaboration and critique, which will improve the collection of knowledge.

### The Indie Web

[Indie Web](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) has a list of websites using opens standards and posting open information on their sites first.

### Private?

A private wiki will likely atrophy and die. This is the least ideal option and is not being considered.

### Hybrid?

A hybrid approach to public and private information would make just about everything on the wiki publicly accessible but some links may go to private school resources. This isn't much different that what would happen with the public model.

A true hybrid approach would have an authentication system so some information was only viewable to certain users. This will add unneeded friction and complexity

## Single Editor or multiple

### Single Editor

If only a single editor has control then it is more of a public digital garden. Changes could be suggested by users or students but would be committed by a single author. This is likely the best way to start the wiki, although it is not really a wiki unless there are multiple contributors.

### Multiple Editors

If there are multiple editors there likely needs to be an approval process of edits, although this could be cumbersome. Ideally if the wiki grows to have enough valuable resources then the more people that contribute the better. This is a long term goal of the project.

There could be a handful of approved editors that are able to make changes. If there are multiple editors, it limits the backend software to those that can verify credentials and have user accounts.

## Future Proofing and Avoiding Software Lock-In

### Flat Files vs Database

So far everything in this project is written in simple markdown files. These are relatively human decipherable text files that can easily be converted into static HTML documents and viewed on the web.

The benefit of using multiple markdown files is that computers should be able to read them forever and it is possible to switch to other platforms. The downside of using markdown is it is not WYSIWYG so if there are multiple editors then the editors must learn markdown. [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)and [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/) solve this problem by having visual editors for users that do not know markdown.

Both of these use a database to keep track of the content and the media. That is not a problem but it does add complexity to the project and requires a server to host the files. [Docuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki)is an option that uses flat files but it also requires a hosting server because it is put together with PHP.

## Choosing a Platform

The main choice is between a Static Site Generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and an actual [wiki software](https://www.wikimatrix.org/).

The platform should be easy to edit on mobile and desktop. It should be designed mobile first and accessible. Needs to be able to support lots of embedded images, videos and sounds. Needs wikilinks and backlinks. Needs to be easily skinnable and customizable. It must use open formats for all data storage so migration to different hosting and or platforms in the future is possible.
