An installation considers the context of the display of the artwork. Instead of being an object or image that mainly stands on its own an installation involves the site as well as the object(s). Good art installations transform the perception of the space and the included objects. If an art installation can only function in a single location is is a [site-specific](site-specific.md) installation.

## Art Installation Cheat Sheet

1. Have something really big and put it somewhere
2. Have something really small and put is in a big empty space.
3. Have a tremendous amount of small things and fill a space with them.
4. Have few semi large objects and line them up in a row in an empty space.

## Documentation of Installation Work

Important to have compelling images and video that may not fully explain the installation but hook the viewer into wanting to see more.

## Equipment

Example of [Temporary-Power-Distribution](../electronics/temporary-power-distribution.md) for outdoor [art-installations](../sculpture/art-installations.md) that need electrical power.
