Public art is often funded by public funds such as tax revenue or private funds designated for public art in locations with a percent for art legislation requirements for building improvements.

To find artists to commission, public art agencies regularly hold open calls for submissions. These calls can be separated into two categories, Requests for Qualifications (RFQ) and Requests for Proposals (RFP). Generally it is better to apply for RFQs since you don't want to design a proposal for a sculpture without being paid for your time. But when starting out, it can be advantageous to apply for RFPs when you may not have the work history and portfolio to compete in RFQ open calls.
