## What is Installation Art?

Installation art often takes a three-dimensional form. The work is more intentionally "installed" than an object on a pedestal or a painting on a wall. While often large in scale, installation art can be very small. The space around any objects in the works is considered part of the artwork. The experience of the view observing or moving through space can be part of the work. [Site-specific](../sculpture/site-specific.md) installation art takes the consideration of the environment further by making art that can only be displayed or made complete at a specific location or under specific conditions. If the site specific work is removed from that context, then it would cease to be that work of art.
