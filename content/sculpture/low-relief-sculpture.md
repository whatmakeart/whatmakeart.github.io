Low Relief Sculpture is a term used mostly to describe historical artworks typically found on architecture facades. Although less relevant in contemporary contexts some [Sculpture](sculpture.md) and [public art](public-art.md) installations make still be described as low relief.

Low Relief Sculpture can be seen in the stone carvings of Mayan structures, Buddhist shrines, Greek temples, courthouses and other buildings.
