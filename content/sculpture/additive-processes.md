title: Additive Processes
---

Additive processes rely on adding more of the same material to the object until the desired form is achieved. These range from sculpting with clay to [3D-Printing](../digital-fabrication/3d-printing.md).

When sculpting with water based clay or oil clay an [armature](armature.md) is often used. An armature is a support structure made of metal and / or wood that allows the soft clay to keep its shape while being worked on. [Armatures](armature.md) can use low density materials such as paper and foam to quickly bulk up the form of an object or to make a hollow object.
