Armatures give support to a [sculpture](./sculpture.md) in progress. Sometimes armatures are removed and other times armatures remain a permanent piece of the finished work.

A variety of materials can be used to make an armature. Some armatures are designed to be removed before completion of the work and others remain permanently. An armature can be a simple a a balloon for making [paper mache](./paper-mach√©.md) masks or as complex as a support architecturally scaled public art installation that needs to meet strict engineering standards.
