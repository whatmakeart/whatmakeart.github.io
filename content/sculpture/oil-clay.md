Oil Clay is a [Sculpture](sculpture.md) material that stays pliable without water. The oil that binds the clay particles together becomes softer and easier to move as heat is applied either with an electric [how-to-use-a-heat-gun](../tools/how-to-use-a-heat-gun.md) or by manipulating the material. For cantilevered structures or large objects an [armature](armature.md) can be used under the oil clay to give it more strength and not require as much clay by making the object semi hollow.

Oil clay is used to make car models in Industrial Design. Oil Clay models can be made by hand using analog tools or can be carved by [CNC](../digital-fabrication/cnc/cnc.md) machines based on a digital 3D Model.
