## Public Domain Collections

The resources below have collections of public domain, images, videos and sounds and offer them for use free of charge. They are also relatively reputable sources so you can be sure that the resources are actually in the public domain, unlike some random websites that claim to have public domain images without providing reliable means of verifying their claims. It is not uncommon to find copyrighted images and content falsely listed on less reputable "public domain" collections.

A funny example of copyrighted material being mislabeled as public domain happened when a photo of BJ Novak, and actor from the TV show _The Office_, showed up in advertisements and product packaging in multiple countries. After learning about the mistake he did not pursue legal action and laughed off the incident Under different circumstances the companies and designers who did not verify the source of the images they were using could have been required to pay large monetary compensation to the copyright holder as well as suffering damage to their professional reputation.
