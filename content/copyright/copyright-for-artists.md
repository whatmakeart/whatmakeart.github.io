## Public Domain Cases

The [Public Domain](public-domain.md) is a great resource for content creation but artists need to be careful that images are actually in the public domain. If you get an image from a reputable source such as the New York Public Library or the public domain or the [Prelinger Archives](https://archive.org/details/prelinger), you can be reasonably assured that the content is really in the public domain. But if you use less reputable sources such as a search engine, you may find things that people have uploaded and claim to be in the public domain, but that are really copyrighted works created by others.

An example of this is when an actor from the sitcom the office had their face added to a public domain repository and it was incorrectly tagged as public domain. Then many advertising agencies started to use their image without permission on products.

- [ANDY WARHOL FOUNDATION FOR THE VISUAL ARTS, INC. v. GOLDSMITH ET AL.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-869_87ad.pdf)

## Fair Use

[Fair-Use](fair-use.md) is a special part of the United States Copyright Act that allows the use of copyrighted works under certain circumstances.

[Documentary Filmmakers Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use](https://cmsimpact.org/code/documentary-filmmakers-statement-of-best-practices-in-fair-use/)

[CAA Fair Use](https://www.collegeart.org/programs/caa-fair-use)

[CAA Interview with Suzanne Preston Blier on Fair Use](http://www.collegeart.org/news/2020/05/19/suzanne-preston-blier-on-code-of-best-practices-and-fair-use/) - Used images of Picasso's Demoiselles in a book and relied on fair use rather than image rights permissions.

[Picasso images French vs US Court rulings](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Picasso-ruling.pdf) French courts found that the use of the photographs of Picasso's work was infringing but US courts said that it was fair use.

## What Is Not Protected by Copyright?

Copyright does not protect
"

- Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, or discoveries
- Works that are not fixed in a tangible form (such as a choreographic work that has not been
  notated or recorded or an improvisational speech that has not been written down)
- Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans
- Familiar symbols or designs
- Mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring
- Mere listings of ingredients or contents"
  For more information, see Works Not Protected by Copyright (Circular 33).
