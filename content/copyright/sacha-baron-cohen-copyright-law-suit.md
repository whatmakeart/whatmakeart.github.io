A cannabis company used an image of Sacha Baron Cohen's infamous character, Borat, on a billboard advertising their product. The advertisement even used one of Borat's well known phrases, "It's nice!" It appears that the company did not ask permission to use the character's image or phrasing. If courts do not consider it fair use there will likely be monetary damages.
