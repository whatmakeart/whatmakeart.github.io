## Bansky Loses Greeting Card Lawsuit

Bansky lost a suit against a greeting card company that used his image of a monkey with a sandwich board on the cover of one of their cards. They changed the text of the sandwich board but the images was mostly the same.

When the court handed down the ruling they quoted Bansky saying, "Copyright is for losers." and said that this comment by the artist held weight in their decision. In addition the court said that since the artist, Bansky, is anonymous that their is no way to award damages.
