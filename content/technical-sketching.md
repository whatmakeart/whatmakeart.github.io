title: Technical Sketching
---

Technical Sketching is a form of drawing used to visually communicate how and object is made, put together, or how something functions. Often dimensions of the object are written on the sketch as well as the precise scale of the drawing. A scaled drawing allows for small and large objects to be drawn at a reasonable size rather than their respective real world scale. Technical Sketching differs from more creative types of drawing rendering, representational drawing, and concept sketching. Technical Sketching aims to remove any doubt or confusion about the shape and form of an object. This clear and communicative precision is in contrast to creative drawings that can look quite realistic, but do not contain all the needed information to fabricate or manufacture an object A visually stunning rendering of a sports car, or a beautiful rendering of a new house may be necessary to communicate the feeling of a design ir for sales and advertising but technical drawings are needed to communicate how to make the car or house.

There are many types of technical drawings including architectural plans, mechanical drawings, electrical drawings, electronic circuit diagrams, machine processes, site plans, construction drawings.

There are conventions and symbols used to make technical Sketching more efficient. For example in construction drawings for buildingd, all of the details of a light fixture or a window trim do not need to be drawn on the floor plan. A symbol for a light and an indication of a window are sufficient. Separate detail drawings can be included to show the specifics.
