A Raspberry Pi is a single board computer that is often used for low power on-site computing applications. It is also used for [Physical-Computing](../electronics/physical-computing.md) and art installations as well as industrial applications. It has more processing power that the [Arduino](../arduino/arduino-introduction.md) microcontroller
