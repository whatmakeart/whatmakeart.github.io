1. Degrease the screen. Any grease or residue on the screen can inhibit the adhesion of the photo emulsion. It is good practice to clean and degrease the screen before applying emulsion, especially in a shared shop with a borrowed screen of unknown grease content.
2. There are color coded cleaners in the screen cleaning room.
   - Degreaser = Yellow
   - Ink Cleaner = Blue
   - Emulsion Cleaner = Red
3. Use the rag and scrubbing sponge and a small amount of degreaser on the screen. Rinse thoroughly with water. The water should not flow down the screen like a smooth sheen, that means it is greasy. It should bump into the mesh and flow into it. Check the screen by holding it up to the light.
4. Set the screen in front of the fan for ~15 minutes for each side to completely dry.

## Screens

3. The lights have a color filter to block out the gamma percentage needed to expose the photo emulsion.
4. Screens have different resolutions or dot density based on the fineness of the fabric used on the screen. Printing glaze on clay requires wider openings in the fabric then a dot pattern photo. Standard meshes are approximately 180 - 195 lines per inch.

## Degreasing Screens

1. Lights can be on for degreasing screens.
2. The degreaser, cleaner, and emulstion bottles are color coded.
   - Degreaser - Yellow 🟨
   - Cleaner - Blue 🟦
   - Emulsion - Red 🟥
3. Turn the water on but be sure to remember to turn it off since the preasure can build up and damage the hose and flexible fittings. It can also potentially leak and flood the print studio. Turn off the water when done.
4. All of the cleaners are ok for skin contact but you may wear gloves.
5. Put the screen in the sink leaned against the wall,
6. Spray a small ammount of degreaser on the screen. You only need a little bit. Using too much will require more cleaning and if not completely cleaned out can cause issues later in the process.
7. Use the water sprayer from top to bottom and side to side. It might start as a sheen of water down the screen due to contaminates and grease. As th degreaser works then it will start to penerate and flow into the mesh. This is an indication of it working.
8. Flip the screen and repeat the cleaning.
9. Place the screen in front of a fan to dry.
10. Store screens on the racks so they are not damaged while waiting to coat with emulsion.
