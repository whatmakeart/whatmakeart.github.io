Screen printing uses a mesh of fabric attached to a frame to print ink on suitable substrates. Often photo emulsion is used to produce a resist on the screen to determine where the ink is placed.

Student coat their checked out screens in the afternoon.

## Screen Coating Process

1. Emulsion is stored in the fridge to keep it out of the way as as a double light protection barrier. If the emulsion is low, alert the Studio Technician.
2. When opening the lid of the emulsion be careful not to get any on the rim of the container because it will make it harder to open later.
3. Select an appropriately sized emulsion trough.
4. Check both edges of the trough for any burrs or dried emulsion. Make sure to remove any debris so both edges are smooth. Failure to have smooth edges can cause tears in the screen and ruin it.
5. Pour emulsion into the trough. Gauge the amount based on how many screens are being coated.
6. Set your screen on the not slip mat against the board on the table and lean against the wall. The screen should not move if forward pressure is applied.
7. Start on the "inside or top" of the screen so you have the frame as a guide. Use the rounded edge first. Press it firmly against the screen. Tilt the trough toward the screen to let the emulsion come into contact with the screen.
8. Pull the trough up to the top to coat the screen with emulsion. Pause at the top. Tilt the trough back. Pause again to let the emulsion settle in the trough. Pull the trough up a bit and out to remove it from the scree and to avoid drips or runs.
9. Do not start the emulsion in contact with the frame and do not go all the way to the top of the frame with the emulsion. If emulsion gets between the frame and the screen it is difficulty to clean and can begin to degrade the screen.
10. Coat the other side of the screen with the round side of the trough.
11. Use the sharp side of the trough to scape off excess emulsion on both sides.
12. Pour excess emulsion back into the container.
13. Completely clean the trough in the sink. Make sure there is no emulsion in any of the nooks and inside corners. Clean the edges well.
14. Put your screen on the solid shelf rack to dry.
