## Install GitHub Command Line Video Transcript

In this programming for artist tutorial I'm going to show you how to install GitHub command line tools. These are optional tools that you could install to be able to use GitHub from the command line. If you go to cl.github.com it will bring you to this page and it gives you install instructions.

If we've already installed the homebrew package manager on Mac OS we can just type grew install gh. We can also view the installation instructions for other operating systems.

Here it's gives the installation instructions for Mac OS, as well as Linux, and it also gives you the installation options for Windows. After Windows 10 there is a default package manager that you can install with Windows called winget. Simply type this in and then you can use the GitHub command line tools in Windows.

I'm working on a Mac computer so I will follow the instructions for installing with Mac. So here I can copy this command, but where do I paste this command? I paste it into a new Terminal window. Here I have a new Terminal window and I'll paste the command and then it will install.

The first time that you use GitHub command line tools you're going to have to authenticate. We can do this by typing in the following command, we can type gh space a login. It will next ask you which account you want to log into. We want to log into github.com, then we can either use https or SSH, then we can authenticate git with our GitHub credentials by pressing Y, and then we can either log in with a web browser or paste an authentication token.

I'm going to choose login with a web browser. Then we can copy our authentication code and then press enter to open GitHub in the browser. Once you press enter it will bring you to device activation and then we can simply type in our activation code. Once you've typed in your activation code just click continue. Then we can click authorize, then we can click authorize GitHub and you need to confirm your two Factor authentication. Once you've done that you've now authenticated GitHub command line and you can use it on your device.

Hopefully this helps you authenticate GitHub command line with your GitHub account.

Happy programming.
