JavaScript is a programming language used in web development with an ability to add interactivity to web pages. It's a client-side language, meaning it executes in the user's web browser rather than on the web server. Javascript can create interactive features like animated graphics, responsive forms, and complex user interfaces. It is an essential part of web development, along with [HTML](./html.md) and [CSS](./css.md). JavaScript works in tandem with HTML for content structuring and CSS for styling, to create engaging and interactive web experiences and web applications.
