HTML makes the internet go. It is the markup language used for all of the information that you have seen on the internet. A markup language handles the content or information and is less concerned with how the content looks. [CSS](css.md), Cascading Style Sheets, are used to style the content of a webpage. [JavaScript](javascript.md) is used to add functionality to a webpage.
