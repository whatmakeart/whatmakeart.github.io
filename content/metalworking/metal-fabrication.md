# Metal Fabrication

There are multiple ways to [Fabrication](../making/fabrication.md) metal including [Cutting](../making/cutting.md),[bending](bending.md), [Welding](welding.md), [Bolting](../making/bolting.md), [forging](forging.md), [Casting](../making/casting.md) and more. Working with mental can be hazardous so it it essential to follow basic [Safety](../making/safety.md) best practices as well as additional safety precautions depending on the equipment, materials, or techniques being used to fabricate metal.

## Finishing Metal Objects

### How to clean metal and prep for painting

You need to remove all oil and rust, then quickly add a metal primer. Metal primer can have multiple coats and be sanded smooth in between coats. Primer should be applied as soon as new clean metal is exposed. Clean metal should be allowed to touch the atmosphere for as short of time as possible.
