Brazing joins two different metals together with a filler metal that has a lower melting point than the metal being joined. Brazing occurs above 450 degrees Celsius. Under 450C is considered [soldering](../electronics/soldering.md) which is often used in electrical and plumbing connections.

Brazing is used in bicycle frame joints.
